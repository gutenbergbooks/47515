<span class="smcap"><small>Around the Viking House-fire.</small></span></h2>


<p>In the Northland were the roots from which grew the
great nations which now rule the earth. The tribes were
many, but the principal representative and the absorbent
of their thoughts and their traditions may receive from us
the general name of Saxons. These were the swordsmen
of the sea whom the Roman legionaries declared to be the
hardest fighters they had met, whether on land or water.</p>

<p>In the Northland were also the germs of political and
religious liberty, and here were to be found the first forms
of our highest faith.</p>

<p>But the men of the old race sailed southward and then
eastward, at the first, taking their gods with them. Not
until centuries later did they march and conquer this far
western world, but we, their children, still devoutly believe
that the great God came with them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The landward slope of a vast gray granite headland
was thickly covered with towering pine trees. Beyond
them, inland, lay a snowy valley without woods, and beyond
that arose a blue and misty range of mountains.
There were no trees upon the summit of the headland;
only bare rocks, storm worn and deeply furrowed, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
uplifted to meet the bitter wind that swept down over the
flinty ice covering of the North Sea from the yet colder
winter which was manufacturing icebergs within the
arctic circle. Sheer down, hundreds of feet, the perpendicular
face of the cliff smote sharply the glittering level
that stretched away westerly over the sea to the horizon,
while an arm of it pushed in eastward over the fettered
waters of a deep and gloomy fiord, rock-bordered.</p>

<p>Here would evidently be a good harbor in summer,
when the waters should be free, but now it had a forbidding,
dangerous look, and out of the fiord poured continually
a volume of roaring sound, the solemn organry
of the wind playing upon the icy and rocky reflectors.</p>

<p>There was another gigantic sea cliff at a distance of
about a mile down the shore, southerly. Between that
and the headland the ice line curved raggedly inward
along the lines of a sheltered cove, which might at
another season provide a landing place. Midway, and
at the head of the cove, there lay, propped up on either side
by timbers, the bare hull of a well-made vessel. It was of
goodly size, being over thirty paces in length and of full
six paces in width at its middle. At the prow and at the
stern it was high built, with short decks, under which was
room for stowage and for the sheltered sleeping of men.
It was lower made amidships, where were both seats and
standing room for rowers, and on either side were twenty
thole pins. In appearance the hull was somewhat flat-bottomed,
but it had a keel. At the center arose a stout,
high mast, but upon it there was yet neither yard nor
boom nor sail. Both prow and stern were sharply made.
Evident was it that she was new and had never yet
floated. Her outline was of much beauty, and all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
timbers and planks were heavy and strong, that she might
battle with rough seas and with the ice cakes of the spring
breaking. From her prow projected a beak of firmly
clamped and tenoned oak, faced and pointed with iron,
that she might break not only the waves, but the ribs of
other ships. All around her and in some parts over her
lay the white snow, deeply drifted, but wherever the
woodwork was uncovered there could be seen much of
skillful carving and smooth polishing.</p>

<p>At other places along the curve of the cove there were
boats and ships, larger and smaller. All were hauled up
above high-water mark, and snow was on them. The
larger craft seemed to be stanch and seaworthy, but not
any of them were equal in size or in strength or in beauty
to the new warship.</p>

<p>Upon a straight line inland a hundred fathoms, as if
the iron beak were pointing at it, stood a long, low, irregular
building of wood with high ridged roofs, in
which were wide holes at the ridges. From these holes,
as if they were instead of chimneys, columns of blue
smoke were rising to be whirled away by the wind.
Stonework or brickwork was not to be seen. Through
the strong timber walls, under the projecting eaves, were
many openings, equally cut, window-like, for the entrance
of light and air on sunny days, but these all were now
closed by wooden shutters, some of which were braced
from without. The timbers of the house walls were
cleanly hewn and skillfully fitted, and they were tightly
calked with moss and tempered clay. The roofs were of
shingles riven from the pine trees.</p>

<p>Beyond, landward, there were smaller, ruder structures
for the shelter of horses, cattle, sheep, and swine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
there were many ricks of hay and straw and of yet unthreshed
grain. In either direction around the cove and
scattered irregularly up the valley were a number of less
extensive buildings for the abode of men. Some of these
were mere huts, built ruggedly of timber and unhewn
stone. From every roof was there blue smoke rising to
testify that there were no empty houses in this seashore
village of the vikings. Around the central cluster of
buildings there were palisades, but except for these there
were no signs of fortifications. It was as if there need be
little fear of the coming of any foeman.</p>

<p>Bitter and cold and strong was the windstorm that
blew across the icy sea and smote upon the swaying
crowns of the pine forest and howled among the bare
boughs of the oaks. It came and knocked at the great
door in the front of the house pointed at by the beak
which was the forefinger of the ship.</p>

<p>The door swung open for a moment and then it closed,
but in that moment there rang out loud voices of rude
song and the twanging of sonorous harp strings. Also
a great blast of fresh, pure air rushed eagerly into the
house, where it was much needed. Not but that the vast
room, low-walled, high-roofed, was fairly well ventilated
in many other ways, but the fire in the middle of its earthen
floor was blazing vigorously, and not all the smoke
might readily escape at the round gap in the roof ridge
over it. Now and then, indeed, the wind blew rudely
down through that aperture and sent the smoke clouds
eddying murkily among the rafters.</p>

<p>But for the fire blaze and for sundry swinging cressets
filled with burning pine knots the great hall would have
been gloomily dark, but these lights were enough, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of the smoke clouds, to show many things which told of
what sort this place might be. So also might be plainly
noted the faces and the forms of the men who sat or
stood around the fire, or who lay upon the bearskins and
the wolfskins that were scattered here and there upon the
earth floor and upon the wooden settles along the walls.</p>

<p>A broad table ran across a raised dais at one end of the
room, and on this were not only pitchers and mugs of
earthenware variously molded, with many drinking
horns, but there were also tankards and goblets and salvers
of silver, richly designed and graven by the artisans
of other lands than this. Of the articles of furniture for
different uses some few had an appearance of having been
brought from far, but the great, high-backed oaken
throne chair behind the long table, at its center, was rich
with the grotesquely elaborate carvings of the old North
people. On the walls hung shields and arms and armor
of many patterns. The steel caps of the vikings hung
side by side with visored helmets that told of Greece and
Rome and of lands yet further east. There were many
men in the room. Some of them were scarred old warriors,
but there were youths of all ages above mere boyhood.
Likewise were there numbers of women.</p>

<p>As central as was the fire itself were three figures
which seemed to attract and divide the attention of all
the others. On the side of the fire toward the door
towered one who looked a very embodiment of the warlike
young manhood of the race of Odin. His blond beard
and mustache were full but not yet heavy. His complexion
was fair, notwithstanding its weather bronzing, and
his steel-blue eyes seemed both to flash and to laugh as he
stood with folded arms and listened. His dress was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
simple. His shoes, that arose above his ankles, were well
made. Above them were leggings of tanned leather, and
he wore a tunic of thick, blue woolen cloth. He was
unarmed except for the slightly curved, broad-bladed
seax in its sheath that hung from his belt. Its blade was
not more than a cubit in length. It was sharp on one
edge only, and it was heavy. The steel hilt and the
crosspiece were thick, for a good grip. It was a weapon
terrible to meet if it were in the hand of an athlete like
this&mdash;more than six feet in height, deep-chested, lithe and
quick of motion&mdash;and already the short seax had won for
its bearers, the Saxons, a dreaded name among all the
peoples of the south countries to which their swift keels
had carried them.</p>

<p>At the left of the fire was a large, high-backed chair
made of some wood which had become almost black with
age and smoke. It was not now occupied, but in front of
it stood the form of a woman, straight as a pine and
taller than any of the men around her. Her face was
swarthy, deeply marked, haughty, and her abundant hair
fell disheveled down to her waist, as white as the drifts
upon the mountains. She was clad in a robe of undyed,
grayish wool, falling loosely to her feet. On these were
socks and buskins, but her lean, sinewy arms were bare
as she stretched them out, waving her gnarled old hands
in time to the cadence of a semimetrical recitation. She
spoke in the old Norse tongue, with a voice upon whose
power and mellowness time seemed to have had little
effect. Every head in the hall bent toward her, as if her
words were a fascination to her hearers, and none willed
to interrupt her.</p>

<p>Weird and wild was the chant of the old saga woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and the fire in her piercing black eyes brightened and
dulled or almost went out as she sang on, from myth to
myth, of the mystical symbolisms of the intensely poetic
and imaginative North. Gods and demigods and goddesses,
heroes and heroines, earth forces and spiritual
powers, dwarf and giant, gnome and goblin, fate maidens,
werewolves, serpent lore, the nether frost fires, the
long night of the utter darkness, the twilight of the gods,
the eternal hall of the slain, the city of Asgard&mdash;long and
wonderful was the saga song of the white-haired woman
who had, it was said, seen the ice of more than fivescore
winters float out of the North Sea.</p>

<p>She ceased speaking and sank back into the chair as
if all life had gone out of her. Rigid and motionless she
sat, and there was no light in her eyes, but none went near
her, nor did any speak. There was indeed a momentary
outburst of approval, but it hushed itself. Even a fierce
laugh that came to the lips of the tall young warrior died
away half uttered.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment another sound began to
fill the hall. It came, at the first, from a large harp that
stood a few paces back from the fire. Over the strings of
this harp were wandering the long, bony fingers of a pair
of gigantic hands, while behind it, on a low stool, swayed
and twisted a form whose breadth of shoulder and length
of arm were out of all proportion to its height. The
head was bald except for a fringe of reddish-gray hair
above the ears. The face was scarred and seamed to distortion,
the right eye having been extinguished by a
sword stroke which, by its furrow, must have half cloven
the frontal bone. Age was indicated by the tangled gray
beard which floated down below the belt, but not in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
powerful, rich-toned voice of the harper, for the smoke
seemed to eddy and the fire to dance as the harp twanged
more loudly, and then there came to join it a burst of
stormy song&mdash;a song of battles on the land and on the sea;
a song of the mighty deeds done by the warriors of old
time; a song of fierce and stirring incitement to the performance
of similar feats by those who listened.</p>

<p>The harp grew then more softly musical, for he sang of
the blue waves and the sunny shores of the southern seas;
of their islands of beauty; of their harbors of peace and
their cities of splendor; of temples and castles; of gold
and silver and gems; but he seemed to drift beyond all
these into a song of something beautiful, which yet was
vague and far away and indescribable. His thought and
word concerning it became like a refrain, until the minds
of all who heard were filled with ideas of the dim and
unattainable glory of the land of heroes, the city of the
gods, the return of the White One, and the rising of the
sun that will never set. Like deep answering unto deep
were the last utterances of harp and harper, and as they
suddenly ceased the tall young warrior stepped forward
two paces and cried loudly:</p>

<p>"O Hilda! wise woman of the hundred winters, if this
is indeed to be thy last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall go out with the spring flood," she said, interrupting
him, "but thou wilt be upon the sea when they
lay me in the cleft between the rocks."</p>

<p>"I will go forth as thou sayest," he responded. "Am
I not of the sons of the gods? I will sail as my father
sailed and as Oswald has sung. I will crush, like him,
the galleys of the Romans. I will look upon the cities
of the east and of the south. I am of Odin's line. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
go out in the good ship <i>The Sword</i>, and will sail until
I see the hero god and the city of the gods and the land
of the living sun."</p>

<p>Loud now rang the shouts of approval from the
bearded vikings as they sprang to their feet and began to
crowd around their young leader.</p>

<p>"Go, O Ulric, son of Odin! Sail on into the sunset
and the farther sea!" came trumpetlike from the white
lips of Hilda.</p>

<p>Low sounds arose, too, from the strings of the harp,
but the door swung suddenly open and upon the threshold
stood a man garbed in wolfskins.</p>

<p>"Hael, Ulric the Jarl!" he shouted, and there were
many exclamations here and there around the room.</p>

<p>"Hael, Wulf the Skater!" heartily responded Ulric.
"What bringest thou?"</p>

<p>"Good tidings!" replied Wulf, joyously, stepping forward.
"I came down the mountain slide and across the
fiord. No other foot will cross it this season. During
days the ice hath weakened and now the wind is changing
southerly. There is already a rift in the sky. O
son of Brander the Brave, be thou ready for the spring
outing!"</p>

<p>"Odin!" shouted Ulric. "Keels for the open sea!
Hael to the cruise of <i>The Sword</i>! Hael to the bright
south! And I, Ulric the Jarl, I of the sons of the gods,
I will go out and I will not return until I have looked into
the face of one of the gods. And he will know me, and
he will take me by the hand, and he will bid me walk with
him into the city of the living sun!"</p>

<p>Glad were the hearts of all the vikings as they heard,
and with one accord they shouted loudly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hael to Ulric the Jarl! Hael to the cruise of <i>The
Sword</i>! We are his men and with him we will go!"</p>

<p>Long had been the winter and slow had been the coming
of the change for which men waited. Welcome was
Wulf the Skater, but Oswald's fingers were slowly busy
among the strings of his harp, and they found strange
sounds which came out one by one.</p>

<p>"The message of the harp!" muttered Hilda. "It is
like the moaning of the sea in the fiord in the long night."</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Going Out of the Ice.</small></span></h2>


<p>Wulf the Skater brought true tidings to the house
of Ulric, the son of Brander the Brave, on the day of
Saturn. Winter was ending. The word passed on from
house to house until all in the village came out and looked
upward, seeking for the blue rift in the sky. The wind
blew not now as in the morning. The north wind had
gone elsewhere, and instead there came up from the south
a breathing which was fitful and faint at first. It was
cool, also, from having touched the frost faces on its way.
Only one more hour went by and the sky was almost
clear, so that the sun shone down unhindered and his heat
was surprisingly strong.</p>

<p>The south wind grew warmer and more vigorous toward
sunset, but with him now came a fog so dense that
no man cared to go out into it; for if he did, it was as
though darkness touched him. All through the evening
the south wind sighed softly among the homes of the
vikings, and went wandering up the fiords, and felt its
way, shivering, across the flinty levels of the frozen sea,
but toward the morning of the day of the sun the breeze
brought with it, also, to help it, a copious warm rain.
Before the noon torrents were leaping down the sides of
the mountains and the sea was beginning to groan and
heave and struggle in its effort to take off and put away
its winter mail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harken!" said Oswald, the harper, as he sat by the
now smoldering fire in the hall of Ulric's house.</p>

<p>"I hear," said Hilda from her place on the other side
of the ash heap. "It is the last time that I shall listen
to the song of the outing ice, but I shall feel the wind
from the sun land and I shall see the grass green in the
valley before I go. There will be buds on the trees when
I pass down into the earth to meet my kindred. O what
a realm is that! The land of shadows. The under world
which has the sod for a roof. But the old runes on the
rocks tell of wide places. One may travel far in that land,
and where I may go I know not."</p>

<p>The gnarled fingers of Oswald were searching among
the strings of his harp, but only discords answered his
touches.</p>

<p>"I have heard," he said, "that they hang their shields
on the roots of the trees, and they see as we see in a twilight.
I think I have heard them harping in the summer
nights, when the moon was full and the wind was in the
pines. I would that my own harp might be buried with
me."</p>

<p>"No need," said Hilda. "They have better harps
than thine. They will give thee one. It is well that the
weapons of a warrior should be placed beside him in his
tomb, but they must be marred in token that he useth them
no more. He hath left others for his kinsmen. There
are many good swords in the old tombs. One day they
will all be opened and the blades will be found."</p>

<p>"And also much treasure," grumbled Oswald; but his
harp twanged angrily as he said it, for he had ever been
a man to hold fast anything in the shape of coined money
or of precious metal. Many were said to be the outland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
coins in his leather bag in his room at the southerly end
of the house. He had sometimes shown them to inquiring
folk, but grudgingly, and he had always tied them
up again tightly, as if he feared that there might be a
thief even among the vikings.</p>

<p>Hilda arose and walked slowly across the room to the
open door. She looked toward the sea, but the mist and
the rain were a curtain.</p>

<p>"Hammers!" she said. "I can hear them. Ulric and
his men are at work upon the ship. She will be ready
to launch when the ice goeth out. She will sail to the
Middle Sea, but when I look for her I cannot see her
come again."</p>

<p>Once more she turned, and this time her slow and
stately march carried her to the farther end of the hall,
on the dais, where many suits of armor were hanging.
She went straight to one of these and she touched it,
piece by piece, while Oswald leaned upon his harp and
watched her.</p>

<p>"When the hour was upon me," she said, "I saw the
son of Brander in battle, and the men upon whom his ax
was falling bore shields like this. There were dark men
with them, wearing turbans. It is well. I think that at
the end of this cruise he will come to me where I am. It
were no shame to his father's son that the valkyrias, when
they come to call the hero to Valhalla, should find him
circled with slain Romans. Brander the Sea King took
these arms for his trophies in the great fight off the coast
of Britain. He drove the Roman galley ashore. He
burned it with fire. Not one Roman escaped."</p>

<p>"I have seen Britain," muttered Oswald.</p>

<p>"Brander the Brave liked Britain well," continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Hilda. "It is a fair land, he said. If he could take more
men with him, he would drive out of it the Romans and
the Britons and keep it. But he said they have no good
winters there, and the summers are all too long. It would
be no land for me. What would I do in an island where
the fiords do not shut up at the right season? I should
perish!"</p>

<p>Very thoughtful was the face of the tall daughter of
the Northland as she passed along, inspecting the armor
and talking to herself about its varied history. Some
of it had been won in fights with far-away peoples before
she was born, but more of it had been brought into that
hall before her eyes, and she had heard the bringers tell
the tales which belonged to its pieces and to the swords
and spears. Now, therefore, hanging there on the wall,
the war treasures of the house of Brander were page-marks
for her memory, and she also was a book of the
old history of the Northmen from the days of the gods
to this hour of her own closing.</p>

<p>Swiftly went by the day of rain and thaw, but their
work was tenfold in the night which followed it. The
rain fell on the roof in increasing abundance, and the
wind threw it with force against the sides of the house.
The torrents on the mountains grew into small swift
rivers, and they made a continual loud sound of rushing
water; but that was not the tumult which so filled the air
and smote upon the ear. All other sounds were overborne
by the booming and groaning of the ice and by the
roar with which its loosened edges ground against the
granite cliffs in the fiords.</p>

<p>The day of Saturn had been a day of frost and snow
and storm until near its close. The day of the sun had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
brought the sun's breath from his own land and his smile
into the sky, and he had slain the winter at a blow. The
morrow would be the day of the moon, and before its
arrival came now this night of such uproar that Oswald
did not care to touch his harp, and the vikings mended
their armor and sharpened their swords in silence. Hilda
also was long silent, nor had Ulric the Jarl spoken aught
that could be heard by all. When at last his voice arose,
and men put by their work to hear, he gave answer to a
question of Tostig the Red.</p>

<p>"Aye!" he said loudly, "the ship is ready from stem
to stern. We will launch her behind the ice as it leaveth
the shore. We will follow the floes as the tides bear them
southward; ever do they melt as they go. So shall no
other ship sail before us, and we shall be the first of all
keels from the Northland, this year, among the islands of
the Middle Sea."</p>

<p>Fiercely twanged the harp of Oswald and loud rang
the shouts of the men who heard the young jarl speak
his purpose, but before the harp could sound again Hilda
arose in her place.</p>

<p>"Son of Brander," she said, "thou wilt go. Thou
wilt see many things. All day have I been watching thy
path, and the clouds are over it. In this thing that I now
tell thee, do thou as did thy father: crush the keels of
Rome in the seas of Britain and smite the men of Rome
on the British island. And in the end of all thou wilt die,
as did thy father, at the hand of a spearman of Cæsar."</p>

<p>"So be it," shouted Ulric, with a laugh on his lips and
a flash of fire in his bold, bright eyes; "I ask no better!"</p>

<p>He said no more, but seated himself and began to
sharpen his seax on a smooth, hard stone.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Launching of "The Sword."</small></span></h2>


<p>The day of the moon, the second day of the week,
dawned brightly over the village of the vikings. The
faces of the cliffs along the shores of the Northland
boomed back continuous echoes of the thunderous reports
of the splitting ice. The frost had been strong, and the
winter mail of the sea was thick and hard, but the sun
and the lifting tides and all the torrents from the mountains
made a league, and they were more powerful than
was the ice. The south wind also helped them.</p>

<p>All the hours since Wulf the Skater brought the news
of the coming thaw had been spent by Ulric and his men
in getting the good ship <i>The Sword</i> ready for the water.
No room in her was to be wasted, and her hollow, to her
very keel, was now closely packed with provisions, taking
the place of other ballasting. There were tightly stowed
barrels of pork and beef, and there were bags and boxes
of hard bread, and casks of ale and casks of water. Over
the greater part of these were planks fastened down like
a deck, for the voyage to be undertaken promised to be
long, and all except provisions for immediate use must be
sealed until a day of need.</p>

<p>The seats of the rowers were all in, and the short oars,
and also the long oars, which a man would stand erect to
pull with. The small boats were fastened upon the half
decks, fore and aft. The mast was now stayed and rigged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and the spars and the sail had been swung in their
places. Not of woven stuff was the sail, but of many
well-dressed skins of leather, that it might toughly withstand
any gale.</p>

<p>There were twenty oars on a side, and the crew who
were to do the rowing, taking their turns, had been carefully
selected during the winter. Their war shields were
hung along the bulwarks, and they placed them there
with great pride. The chosen men who lived further
inland were now arriving, and they were as eager as were
the men who dwelt on the shore. Stalwart and high-hearted
were all the vikings who were to sail in <i>The
Sword</i>. Among them were veterans who had fought
under Brander the Brave, the father of Ulric, and others
were youths who were now going out for their first venture
in distant seas. Great store of weapons went on
board, for there had been much making of bows and
arrows and swords and spears and shields all winter. So
the gray-headed and caretaking warriors declared that
the ship was exceedingly well provided.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the day of the moon Ulric the Jarl
stood at high-water mark looking seaward.</p>

<p>"As the tide turneth I shall know," he said to those
who were with him. "The flood hath lifted the ice, but
the ebb must lower it. <i>The Sword</i> will be launched at
the next high tide if the outing is good."</p>

<p>That might be toward the evening, and word went out
so that all might be ready.</p>

<p>The ship as yet bore no flag, but on the forward half
deck stood a great anvil, carved finely of oak and blackened,
and upon the anvil was fastened a massive hammer,
made in like manner, that Thor the Great, the god of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the smith god, might go with <i>The Sword</i> into any battle.
Now could more fully be seen the carvings and the gildings
and the many rich ornamentations which had been
lavished upon the ship, and men who now saw her for
the first time marveled at her beauty and at the strength
of her timbers.</p>

<p>"Larger ships have been," they said, "but not many,
nor was there ever one that gave better promise of bearing
well the shock of another ship or the stroke of an ice
floe."</p>

<p>All day the sound of harping could be heard in the
house, for other harpers besides Oswald were now there,
and they played and sang in a rivalry with each other.
Hilda was not to be seen. It was said that she had shut
herself up in her own room and would have none speak
with her. Although the house was thronged, there were
none who thought well to disturb her. Not many, indeed,
were curious enough to pass near the closed door
behind which she was believed to be looking into the
twilight where the gods live, and out of which come those
whose shadows darken the woods at times and whose
voices are heard in the night as they talk to one another
across the fiords.</p>

<p>The noon came and at low tide the ice edge was out
twenty fathoms from the shore, leaving clear water behind
it. If it should shove in again, there would be no
launching, but as the ebb ceased there came an unexpected
help. A mighty drift of snow and ice had formed,
in early winter, hundreds of feet above the level, and yet
in a hollow of the high mountain at the head of the fiord.
Hard and strong was the grasp of this glacier upon the
rocks and trees at its sides, but under it was a stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
which had been covered, though not entirely closed.
Above and beyond was now a lake of melted snow, and
the water from it was forcing its way under the glacier
by that rivulet channel, mining, mining, mining, until its
work was done.</p>

<p>There was a great sound of breaking, a sound that was
sharp, rasping, shrieking, as if the mountain uttered a
great cry to see the glacier tear itself free and spring
forward. The screams of a gier-eagle, startled from the
withered pine tree on the summit, answered the scream
of the mountain. Down, down, faster and faster, to the
sheer precipice at the face of the fiord, and then the
glacier itself uttered an awful roar as it leaped headlong
from the cliff. A thunderous boom responded from the
smitten face of the ice, and through the clefts that were
made in all directions the freed salt water bounded high
into the sunshine, which it had not seen since it was imprisoned
in the dark by the winter. The entire mass
went over, and with it went the bowlders, earth, and trees
which it had rent off and brought away. The blow which
it struck was as a blow from the hammer of Thor, and a
vast wave rolled out of the fiord, breaking the nearer ice
as it went and splitting square miles of the sea face beyond
into floes of a right size for drifting. Out slipped
the ice edge at the cove, a hundred fathoms further. In
it came again angrily, but only to retreat once more and
leave a wider, surer harbor for <i>The Sword</i> to dip her
keel into when her launching hour should come.</p>

<p>All things were ready, both at the house and on the
shore, when Oswald left his harp to go and speak to one
of the maidens, of whom were many come to see the
warriors depart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go thou to Hilda," he said. "Say to her that shortly
she will be needed at the ship."</p>

<p>"Come," said the maiden to other women who were
near her, for she cared not to go alone.</p>

<p>Truly it was not far to go and come, stepped they never
so slowly, and they soon brought back word that her door
was open, but Hilda they did not find, nor did any know
whither she had gone.</p>

<p>"So?" said Oswald, thoughtfully. "Pass thou on,
then, and tell this to Ulric, the son of Brander, for he will
understand. Bid Wulf the Skater and Tostig the Red
that they come now to me."</p>

<p>Hastily went the maiden, for of this errand she had no
fear.</p>

<p>On the summit of a low hill not more than half a mile
from the house was a great heap of stones. Around it,
in an oval, standing like watchful sentries, were many
great stones, tall and upright. Upon the faces of these
uprights were chiseled words in the old runes. A path
that led to this hill had been kept open during the winter,
and when Hilda left the house, with none to mark her
going, she had walked along this path. The snow in it
was soft, taking footprints, and Hilda stooped, looking
closely at some which were already there. She followed
them until they ceased at the heap of stones. She smiled
and bowed her head approvingly.</p>

<p>"Ulric hath been here," she said. "He hath spoken
to his father at the tomb. The son of the hero will himself
be a hero. There is no other like him among the
young branches of the tree of Odin."</p>

<p>Strong affection sounded in her words concerning the
youthful head of the ancient house of Brander the Brave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
A flush came for a moment into her withered face, and
she stood in silence gazing at the tomb. Slowly her arms
arose, waving, and her lips opened in a recitative that
sounded like a song, wherein she was speaking to the
father of Ulric and to other names than his, calling them
her kindred. Louder, more weird, mournful, thrilling,
grew the tomb song of the old saga woman. But it suddenly
ceased, for to her came a response from one that
stood upon the crest of the central heap of stones.</p>

<p>Not in any human voice of the dead or of the living
was her answer, but from the gaunt and grisly shape of a
large gray she-wolf, famished-looking, that stood there,
snapping fiercely her bloody jaws and gazing at Hilda.
Then lifted the wolf her head to send forth a long-drawn,
wailing howl.</p>

<p>The long, late winter had been a hard one for all
wolves and for other wild beasts, for against them the
sheepfolds had been well guarded. And now this hunger-driven
monster from the mountains had taken her
opportunity to venture in almost to the village, finding
this day a flock without a shepherd. She had ravaged
unfought, and now she was here upon the tomb of
Brander. Her presence there was as if she had been a
written message to Hilda.</p>

<p>"Art thou here?" she exclaimed. "Aye! Thou art
as I saw thee at the house. Thou art the name of Rome,
O bloody mouth! Scourge of the world! Curse of all
nations! Hungry one! The swords of the Northmen
shall yet smite the cubs of the she-wolf in their own den."</p>

<p>A sharp, harsh bark, another howl, and a snapping of
jaws replied to her and then the she-wolf sprang away,
disappearing beyond the tomb, but Hilda turned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
walked houseward along the path, muttering low as she
went.</p>

<p>When Tostig the Red and Wulf the Skater came to
Oswald, the harper, he gave them an errand, for they at
once went away together to one of the best made of the
stables in the rear of the house. They had not yet returned
when Hilda walked past the house and on down
to the beach. All men knew that the right hour for the
launching of <i>The Sword</i> had come when Hilda came and
stood at the prow of the vessel, laying her hand upon it.</p>

<p>She spoke then but few words, pointing at the heaps
of driftwood and loose pieces of timber which were there
and giving her commands. Those who heard her began
to gather all this wood into a great heap. It was more
like two heaps, for there was left a bare spot in the middle
large enough for a yawlboat to have been lodged therein.</p>

<p>Ulric, the son of Brander, came and stood by Hilda,
and as she looked at him the color arose again into her
face and a kindly light kindled in her eyes. He also
smiled at her very lovingly. She spoke a word that none
else heard, and he blew three long, powerful blasts upon
his war horn. From all directions came in haste the
vikings and the other shore people and the upland people,
both the old and the young, men and women. From the
house came all who were in it. Oswald and the other
harpers marched to the beach together, bringing their
harps.</p>

<p>Now from the stables beyond the house came Tostig
the Red and Wulf the Skater leading between them,
whether he would or not, the snow-white colt which at
two years seemed large for a four-year-old, but which as
yet had neither been bridled nor mounted. That was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
partly because of the spirit that was in him; for none but
Ulric or Hilda would he willingly let lay a hand upon
him, and his eyes now grew red as if he were fretted overmuch.
As he was led along he reared and plunged and
snorted furiously, but Tostig and Wulf were strong men
and they brought him to the heap of wood and in front of
the hollow in its middle.</p>

<p>Hilda had brought with her a long polished staff of
ash wood, which had something of woven cloth stuff
wrapped closely around it. Now she made a sign to
Oswald and he struck his harp. So did the other harpers,
following him, and the sound of their music stirred the
blood of all who heard, so that the men shouted and
clashed their spears upon their shields. Then ceased all
the harps but that of Oswald, and he sang a song of war
which called upon Odin and all the gods to sail with their
ship, <i>The Sword</i>, and give her a successful cruise, with
many battles and much blood and great plundering and
many burnings of the ships and of the strongholds of
foemen.</p>

<p>The tide was rising fast, but the ice came no nearer the
shore, and it was seen that there would be free searoom
for the launching. All things else were ready for this,
and the launchers with their hammers and their handspikes
were prepared to go to their places. Oswald ended
his song and all looked at Hilda. She did not at once
speak, and her face grew ghastly as the face of one from
whom life had departed. Taller she seemed as she raised
her right hand and pointed to the colt.</p>

<p>"Ulric the Jarl," she said, in a hollow voice, but clear,
"son of Brander the Brave, heir of the old house of the
sea kings, son in the true line of the hero gods and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Odin, slay now the white horse of the Saxons and launch
thy keel into the sea!"</p>

<p>Tostig and Wulf forced back the plunging colt into the
hollow between the heaps, and Ulric walked forward,
drawing his seax as he went. He put his left hand upon
the face of the colt and it stood still, looking at him and
neighing gently, while at every corner of the heaps
torches of blazing pine were thrust quickly in by old
women named for that duty by Hilda.</p>

<p>She had walked away to a little distance from the ship,
and she stood now between the sea and the land, upon a
spot where the sand was dry and smooth. Upon this she
drew runes with the point of the staff that was in her
hand, all the while chanting a saga which none of those
who heard her could understand, except that they knew
in it the names of the gods.</p>

<p>"Son of Odin," she shouted, "strike!"</p>

<p>"Odin!" responded Ulric, as he drove his seax to the
hilt into the breast and through the heart of the colt.</p>

<p>It gave one cry that sounded like a human voice in
sudden despair. It made one plunging struggle, restrained
by Ulric, and then the beautiful animal lay
quivering in the hollow. At once a heap of fuel was piled
in front of it, concealing the sacrifice to Odin, and the
long fingers of the fire seized rapidly upon the dry pine
and the cedar and the firwood.</p>

<p>Loudly sounded the harps. Loud was the song in
which all voices were joining. Out of the fiord came
booming a great roar of the sea, for he was smiting his
crags and dashing the floes of ice against the granite
faces.</p>

</p></div></div>



<p>Hilda came again to the ship, unfolding as she walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>that which was wrapped around her staff, and the south
wind that was blowing blew it out so that all might see.
It was a great banner, for a battlefield or for the mast of
a warship. It was black, and upon it, fully half the size
of the colt which had been slain, was painted the sign of
the race of Brander, only to be carried before chiefs of
Odin's line, the White Horse of the Saxons. Hilda
placed the staff in the hands of Ulric, and he at once
sprang on board the ship. He blew a blast of his war
horn, and in a moment all the launchers were at their
stations. Another blast, and all the rowers came on
board and took their seats, taking hold of the short oars,
ready to dip them, while tenscore more of vikings, fully
mailed and armed, followed and posted themselves fore
and aft, spear and shield and ax in hand. Ulric the Jarl
stood by the hammer of Thor on the fore deck and raised
his horn again. At this third blast, as he blew it, the
launchers hammered hard and plied their handspikes and
their levers.</p>

<p>"Go forth into the sea, O <i>Sword</i>!" shouted Hilda.
"Thy beak shall break the ribs of the triremes and thy
keel shall plow the seas of the south!"</p>

<p>Out sprang the vessel, so deftly shaped, so strongly
made, so well manned, and into the sea she glided, while
Ulric, the son of Brander, lifted high the standard and
sounded again his war horn. Every harp twanged its
loudest, and every horn on board the ship and on the
shore, and every voice, joined in the shout of joy that
hailed so successful a launching.</p>

<p><i>The Sword</i> was now upon the sea, floating at the end
of her shore hawser, while the crew lowered her anchors
from the prow and stern. On the shore the fire flared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
upward like the streamers in the northern sky in
winter.</p>

<p>The pallor on Hilda's face grew ghastlier still, and she
walked to the house, forbidding any to come with her.
As she went she muttered:</p>

<p>"Beautiful is the son of Brander, my boy! my hero! I
love him as if I were his mother. Alas, she is not here
to love him! O, I am old and it may be that I see not
that which I seem to see when my eyes are opened. Not
so! Him I shall look upon no more, nor upon the ship.
I go, for I am very old. But I would that the young
hero might not go down so soon. I would that he might
win love and that he might bring home a bride, lest the
race of Brander the Sea King should die with him. The
gods be his guard where he goeth and the valkyrias find
him not for a season!"</p>

<p>So the lonely old woman went into the house and went
to her own room. She had seen the launching of <i>The
Sword</i>, and the ship was to go out with the outing ice.</p>

<p>Rocking at her anchor lay she now, and all along the
shore were men and women who rejoiced to look upon her
and to think her the most perfect ship that had ever been
built on the coast of the Northland. The fire was blazing
high above the sacrifice to the gods, for many hands were
ready to put on fuel, from time to time, and all knew that
it must burn until <i>The Sword</i> should be out of sight.</p>

<p>It was when the sun was sinking, and the waves were
washing gently and murmuring low along the beach because
of the softness of the warm wind from the south,
that Hilda came again, walking hastily. Her head was
covered with her hood, and they saw not her face, but she
spoke to a youth who stood by a small boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take thy boat," she said. "Go thou to the ship.
Give Hilda's word to Ulric the Jarl. Bid him come to
the shore, coming alone, rowing himself. Stay thou
there until he returneth. Bid him that not one man of
those who are now on board shall come again to the
shore."</p>

<p>The youth sprang into his boat and went with his
message. The men on the ship were greatly busied with
stowing of goods and with other care for the fittings of
all kinds, but they saw his coming, and Tostig the Red
hailed him:</p>

<p>"What doest thou, coming to the ship? Is it not forbidden?"</p>

<p>Then the youth replied with Hilda's message, and
Ulric himself came, but he descended into the boat without
speaking while the youth clambered on board. It
was for him a matter of pride, and a thing to be remembered
in after days, that his was the last foot of any
among the shore people to tread the deck of the beautiful
ship before she should sail for the Middle Sea, and for
the fights in which she was to crush the galleys of those
far-away nations.</p>

<p>Ulric took the oars and rowed to the place where he
saw Hilda awaiting him, and she was alone. She had
her staff in her hand and she was again tracing runes upon
the sand. It was the spot where she had stood before
the sacrifice was slain, and neither man nor woman would
have dared to tread upon it until after the next tide.
This, when it should come, would wash out the marks
which had been made by Hilda. Ulric stepped out and
drew up his boat and walked near her.</p>

<p>"I have sent for thee," she said, "to show thee a thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Thou art ready, and thy ship. See to it that naught else
be sent to her from the shore. None of the men must
again set foot upon the land. Sail thou away this night,
and linger not."</p>

<p>"I had so ordered," responded Ulric. "The ice goeth
out steadily, and we are to follow it. But I am glad to say
this last word with thee, for thou art very dear to me."</p>

<p>"More than my son art thou," said Hilda, "because
thou art also of the sons of the gods."</p>

<p>"There are gods in the south," said Ulric, thoughtfully.
"I have it in my mind that I shall see one of them
before I return. I would that I could see him in battle,
like Thor, or Tiw, or Odin."</p>

<p>"Be thou thyself like one of them," said Hilda, and
she gazed at him lovingly, throwing back her hood.</p>

<p>Very bright were her eyes for a moment and then they
grew sad and dim, as if a mist from the fiord had floated
into them. Ulric looked upon her withered face as if
also it were beautiful to him, and he said:</p>

<p>"Thou art a loving woman and true, and I will keep
thy bidding on the sea and on the land."</p>

<p>"I shall see thee not again," she said, "and I willed to
look upon thy face this once."</p>

<p>"It may be that thou wilt be here when I return," he
responded, but she shook her head.</p>

<p>"Son of Odin, not so," she said, in a low, soft voice,
like that of the young who love and are parting. "Me
thou wilt not see, and I know not if in any manner I am
again to see thee. They of that land into which I quickly
go do sometimes see the people of this land, when the
gods permit. If so, I will come to thee some evening when
there is a silence around thee, and I will touch thee on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
forehead, thus," and she leaned forward and kissed him,
placing her hands upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I will welcome thee!" he said, with a great thrill, and
she stood erect, continuing her last words.</p>

<p>"I have this much more to tell," she said. "Thou
wilt sail far and contend with many. As thou knowest
well, thou wilt meet no foemen like the men of Rome, on
land or sea. Thou wilt not tarry long in any place, for
thou art a viking, and thou hast no home in the south.
Thou wilt go on from place to place until thou shalt come
to this harbor, or city." She pointed at the runes drawn
upon the sand at her feet, and he replied:</p>

<p>"I cannot read them, O Hilda! They are in another
tongue. They are unlike any that I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Neither can I read them," said Hilda. "But note
them with care, for when thou seest them upon the
ground of any land thy voyage is ended."</p>

<p>So Ulric stooped low and studied well the deeply
graven furrows which the saga woman, the seeress, had
drawn upon the sand. They were in shape like this:</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30%" >
<img src="images/038.jpg" alt="furrows" style="width: 70%" />
</div>


<p>"Thou seest?" she said.</p>

<p>But the runes were close to the water's edge and the
tide was coming in. At that moment came a great swell
out of the fiord, rising and surging along the beach, and
it put out a hand of foam, glittering in the light from the
setting sun. Hilda stepped back beyond its reach, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
so did Ulric, for a sound came with it. Back fled the
billow, breaking as it went, but it left behind it no trace
of those strange runes on the sand.</p>

<p>Hilda clasped Ulric in her arms, for a moment, but she
did not weep.</p>

<p>"Go thou to thy ship," she said. "I go to my own
place."</p>

<p>"Farewell, my best friend," he replied, but she turned
and walked away, and all who met her made room for
her, for a low voice like a wail crept out from under her
hood, and she did not walk firmly, as was her custom.</p>

<p>"Very great was her love for the son of Brander," said
all of them; and they knew that this was her last season,
for she had told them so, even at Yule.</p>

<p>Ulric rowed to the ship and went on board. The
youth returned to the shore with his boat. The sailors
pulled up the anchors. Then the watchers on the shore
saw the long oars go out, the rowers standing in their
places on either side of the ship, while the young jarl, the
leader of men, stood alone at the stern, steering with one
hand while the other held his war horn. Long and
powerful was the blast he blew, for it was a farewell to
the Northland and to the people he was to see no more.
So sailed away the good ship <i>The Sword</i>. It had been
a grand launching, but there were those upon the beach
who turned and went away to their houses mournfully,
even weeping.</p>

<p>In the house of Brander there was silence. Hilda had
gone to her own room. All guests had departed. The
household folk were for the greater part at the beach, by
the fire of sacrifice, and Oswald, the harper, sat in his
place with his harp before him, leaning upon it.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Ship "The Sword" and the Ice King.</small></span></h2>


<p>The morning of the day of Tiw dawned mistily across
the cold North Sea. Everywhere, as the sun looked in
through the floating curtains of fog, he could see steel-blue
waves wrestling foamily with the masses of ice.
Who in this place would imagine that in some other, far
away, the same sun had found the bright flowers and
green leaves of the fully opened spring?</p>

<p>The wind increased with the coming of the sunshine,
as if the additional warmth brought to it better strength
wherewith to blow away the mists. One mound of white
vapor had been thicker and higher than its neighbors. It
had gathered over something that it was hiding, but the
breeze blew now a short, sharp gust and the mound was
gone. So was uncovered the good ship <i>The Sword</i>, and
her crew could discern what things might be around
them.</p>

<p>Ulric the Jarl was standing in full armor on the fore
deck. He had been waiting for this clearing, and now
he put his horn to his lips. He blew it lustily, and all
who heard him raised a shout, for they knew that no land
was in sight and that their voyage had begun.</p>

<p>"We have gone far in the night," said a large man
standing near the jarl. "But there is much ice. We
can do little more than drift, but we can use the oars somewhat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall go but little faster than doth the ice," replied
Ulric. "But, O Knud the Bear, thou wilt off with that
black shirt of thine when this sun is higher."</p>

<p>There was loud laughing at that, for Knud was clad in
the warm skins of the bears he had slain. Even upon his
head was that which had covered the skull of the largest
of them. Good clothing it was for winter time, but it
was likely to prove heavy gear for southern wearing.</p>

<p>The jarl gazed southward, hoping to see open water,
but only ice fields lay between him and the horizon. The
mist was fast disappearing, nevertheless, and those who
were watching were seeing further; but now a great cry
arose from the stern, where Wulf the Skater was taking
his turn at the helm.</p>

<p>"O jarl!" he shouted. "Mark! Seest thou how we
are pursued? Come hither!"</p>

<p>Down from the fore deck and quickly along the ship to
the after deck went Ulric and those who were with him,
and there was no need for any man to point with his hand
as Wulf was pointing.</p>

<p>"The ice king!" he said, shivering. "I told thee how
I saw him anchor off the North Cape when the leaves fell,
and the first freezing put ice around him over the calm
waters. He came down from his own place that far last
summer. He seemeth to me to be as tall as ever, and he
hath many strong floes with him."</p>

<p>Ulric looked, and so did they all, saying nothing at
first, for the sight was rare. Not often did any mountain
of ice float into that water; and here was a mighty
one. His peak arose, they could not tell how high, and
the sun was glittering gorgeously among his crags.</p>

<p>"He is moving faster than we are!" exclaimed Tostig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the Red. "He will strive to overtake us. He could
crush us like a nutshell with one of his crags."</p>

<p>"We will keep out of his path if we may," responded
Ulric. "But how is it that he saileth along so well
against the wind without oars? There is no tide. If
there were any current, it would be with us as much as
with him."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Tostig the Red. "But did not Hilda ever
tell thee? I have heard her speak of these ice kings.
The gods that walk on the bottom of the sea push him
along that he may go south and die, for his time hath
nearly come. Never, I think, was anything like him seen
below the fiords until this day."</p>

<p>Vast, truly, was this ice mountain which was nearing
them, propelled by some unseen hand. If there had been
a strong undercurrent it would have moved the wonder
from the north in precisely this manner. Nevertheless
all Northmen of the sea knew that any peak of ice above
the surface must rest upon a mass of ice seven times
greater.</p>

<p>All the vikings upon <i>The Sword</i> watched earnestly for
the next sign of whatever was to come, but Ulric took the
helm and sent the rowers to the long oars, two men to
each oar. Well and vigorously did they row, and the
ship was deftly steered into and through one after
another of the open channels between the small floes
around her. Much distance was gained, but at last the
ice fields beyond began to close tightly and the rowing
ceased.</p>

<p>"Son of Brander!" shouted Knud the Bear from the
fore deck. "Mark! The floes are lifting!"</p>

<p>All saw that it was true. Under all the nearer ice-pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a hidden field, the forefoot of the iceberg, was slipping
steadily on unseen until those floes rested upon it. And
now there came a grating sound along the keel of <i>The
Sword</i>, and she too was lifted. The ice arose with her,
so that she sat firmly in a great cleft of it, remaining upright,
indeed, but as completely out of water as she had
been upon the strand before her launching.</p>

<p>Silent and stern stood Ulric, facing the ice king and
asking of himself, "My voyage hath but begun, and is it
ended? Was my ship built for this?"</p>

<p>Not so was it with the mind of Knud the Bear, for he
gazed long and joyously upon the untellable beauty and
majesty of the ice king, and then with a great laugh he
shouted:</p>

<p>"Sons of the Northland, the gods are with us. They
have sent him. Nothing can stay him. He will carry us
fast and far. There will be no toilsome rowing, and we
need not care for the direction of the wind. The gods of
the frozen sea come with him. They would send us
south that they may go and fight the gods of the islands
where there is no ice, for they hate them."</p>

<p>"So be it!" replied Ulric, gloomily, but he looked again
and he said to Knud, "I know not the ice gods, but I think
there are friends of thine yonder. Seest thou?"</p>

<p>Every man was gazing, for there was naught else left
to do. Around the pinnacles and the cliffs of the ice king
there were sea birds flying and screaming. On the snow-packed
levels there were brant and geese and ducks and
other fowl that should have been at the south by this time,
and that would soon, no doubt, be going.</p>

<p>"Odin the Strong!" exclaimed Knud, "I see what thou
meanest. I had seen a white fox, I thought, but yonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
are the bears of the night country. They are white, that
they may see one another in the dark, and there is nothing
else that is so fierce as they are."</p>

<p>"Hilda sayeth," replied Ulric, "that all the world north
and east of us must forever belong to the sign of the bear.
Hast thou ever slain one of these white ones?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Knud. "I have not hunted to the northward
so far as to know much of them. Wulf the Skater
hath met them oft enough on the north coast, but they go
back into the night, for they hate the sun. If it would
not anger the ice king, I would go out and slay one even
now. But he brought them with him."</p>

<p>So thought others of the vikings, as if the crew of
white monsters now clambering nearer over the rugged
ridges of the ice were as his own cattle to the mighty
gnome who had builded this frozen tower for his castle.</p>

<p>"As many they are," said Tostig, "as the fingers of a
hand. I have heard that they have no fear of men."</p>

<p>If the bears had no fear, they at least had much curiosity,
and they were coming to inquire what this might be
that lay upon the ice with so many men walking around
within it.</p>

<p>Ulric went into the after cabin for a heavier spear than
was the light weapon he had with him, saying to Knud,
"White bear have I never slain. This chance is mine, but
the second fight belongeth to thee. I do not rob thee of
thy hunt."</p>

<p>"Thine by right, O jarl, is yonder great one," replied
Knud. "No man may go before thee unless thou wert
hurt or dead. But I warn thee that the long claw, over
there, were he to grapple thee, is worse to meet than
might be three Romans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would face more than three Romans," laughed Ulric.
"But thy pale friend on the floe is a king of bears."</p>

<p>He returned speedily, armed and armored for battle.
The spear he brought was long and strong, with a steel
crossguard at the heel of its broad blade. It was very
sharp, but its weight would have been unwieldly for a
slight man.</p>

<p>Twenty fathoms from the stern of the ship stood the
great bear growling, and the others walked around at a
greater distance. He was a fathom and a half in length
and his paws were tremendous, with claws like reaping
hooks. No man ever faced any beast more terrible in
aspect than was that angry monster from the darkness
which broodeth over the forever frozen sea.</p>

<p>Down stepped Ulric, and when he was a few yards
from the ship some of the men followed with Knud, but
not too near, lest any should seem to help and so should
spoil the honor of the fight.</p>

<p>The surface of the ice was broken and there were
chasms in it, but it was as firm to stand upon as the dry
land. Moreover, <i>The Sword</i> was now lying not far away
from the mighty perpendicular front of the ice king.
None knew yet what might be his aspect looking northward,
and there were those among the vikings on the ship
who shook their heads doubtfully, considering this matter
of the bears.</p>

<p>Stone still stood this bear, growling at intervals, until
the jarl drew within six paces, holding his spear leveled.
Then, with a loud roar and a clashing of his teeth, the
huge beast made his rush, rising upon his hind feet and
spreading his enormous arms to close with Ulric. Had
he done so his hug would have been speedy death, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
point of the spear met him firmly, with a thrust which
buried the blade to the crossguard midway between his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"That would slay anything else that liveth," said Knud
to Tostig, "but the white ones die hard. Mark! the jarl!
The son of Brander! It is grand!"</p>

<p>His comrades answered with a shout and then they
were still, and so were all the vikings, who crowded the
decks and bulwarks of the ship, looking on.</p>

<p>Horrible was now the roaring of the bear as he struggled
against the spear of Ulric, striving to plunge nearer.
What tenacity of life must have been his, to fight on with
the spear blade in him so deeply! Around swung Ulric
on the slippery ice and his whole frame was strained to
its uttermost endurance by the swift changes of that
wrestling, but the plunges of the bear forced him backward
a fathom at a time. His face was now but an arm's
length from that of his vast antagonist, and they were
looking each other eye to eye. Red and yet full of green
fire were the eyes of the bear, and his teeth glistened awfully
in their ranges as his wide jaws opened to gnash
them. But that the descendant of Odin was many times
stronger than other men the combat might here have
ended.</p>

<p>"Slip not now!" shouted Knud. "Son of Brander,
there is a chasm behind thee. Stand fast, if thou canst!
Thou art beyond our help!"</p>

<p>Only his own length from him was the cleft in the ice
floe, and it went down to deep water. If he should fall
into it in his heavy armor, none might hope to see him
again.</p>

<p>Roar&mdash;roar&mdash;roar&mdash;in dreadful wrath and pain struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the bear, for this was his death throe; but Ulric's
foot found a brace&mdash;a break in the ice&mdash;and he gathered
his last strength, the strength of the sons of Odin, the
hero might of the old gods.</p>

<p>Snap! The tough ashen shaft of the spear broke at
the guard, and both bear and hero fell heavily, but Ulric
arose with his seax in his hand. The claws of the bear
wrenched away his shield as if it had been a piece of
oaken bark, but the seax was driven in to the hilt, and as
it came flashing out the life of the bear came with it.
Over he rolled with a loud shriek, that was echoed back
from the face of the ice king. Then he stretched himself
at full length upon the ice and lay still, while Ulric
stepped forward to cut off his forepaws for a token.</p>

<p>"Hael!" shouted every voice among the vikings, as the

of Brander! The son of Odin! Hael to the first good
death and to the long cruise of <i>The Sword</i>!"</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Unknown Thing.</small></span></h2>


<p>The ice king had lost only one of his fierce white flock.
It had been the largest of them all, however; and in the
latter part of Tiw's day there had been a feast of his flesh.
Greatly had the crew of <i>The Sword</i> enjoyed that feast,
and they believed the saying of Knud that there was courage
and strength to be gained by such eating after so
brave a battle. "The gods themselves eat mightily," he
said, "and they have nothing better than this."</p>

<p>During that day a number of the vikings went out to
explore the ice fields somewhat, and they captured many
wild fowl easily with bow and arrow. They reported
having seen in the distance other animals, like great seals
or walruses. They also planned to hunt the remaining
bears, but the jarl forbade it, being unwilling that they
should go far from the ship lest harm should befall them
from sudden breaking of the ice.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to all testing, it seemed to be packing
even more firmly. The entire visible mass of it drifted
steadily southward, as if the ice king, or the under gods
who were pushing him, knew of the channels by which
they were to steer him into other seas than this.</p>

<p>Night came, and then the day of Odin. But now the
worst foe of the ice king, deadlier than even the sun, was
wearing him away with floods of warm rain. There
were rivulets pouring down his sides, and some of his pinnacles
and crags came crashing, thundering down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
time to time. This was, therefore, not a good day for
hunting, and the vikings passed it on board the ship, or
near it, but not dismally, for there were among them
many whose minds and tongues were busy with old voyages
and old fights, and the land to which they had sailed.
Also there were songs to sing, and there was much ale,
and no man was hindered from feasting. It was a time,
too, for the remembering of sagas, and many spoke of
Hilda, but Ulric did not utter her name, saying rather
that it would be well if Oswald and his harp were on
board.</p>

<p>These two, indeed, the saga woman and the old harper,
sat at home in the house of Brander that rainy day, speaking
to one another across the ash heap, on which a slow
fire smoldered. Their talk was of many things, but from
all it would ever come back to some word concerning the
ship and her crew and Ulric. To others Hilda had
spoken little, and they noted that she had not eaten since
the launching. Oswald was fretful and fitful, and he
said that he cared not for harping. In an early hour of
the day he had gone out and he had even climbed to
the crag on the top of the headland that he might look
far to seaward, but he had returned, shaking his head, to
say to Hilda:</p>

<p>"All is ice! She is out of sight, but the floes have
closed behind her."</p>

<p>"So they close not before her I care little," replied
Hilda. "They will conquer the ice, for the sun will help
them, and they are sailing nearer the sun."</p>

<p>Oswald was long silent then, and at last he arose and
walked out of the hall while Hilda went to the door and
gazed seaward. It was to his own room that the harper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
made his way, leaving his harp near the dais. In a far
corner of the house he had been given his place, for he was
held in high honor. Nevertheless, it was but small, and
bare save for a table and a lamp thereon and a stool.
There was, also, a heap of skins for warm sleeping, and
from under this Oswald drew out something, stooping
and then looking behind him to be sure the door was
closed. "What will the jarl bring me, when he returneth
from the southlands?" he muttered. "Bright gold, I
hope, for there is more to love in the yellow, the heavy,
than there is in light silver. The touch is not the same,
and gold hath a better ring."</p>

<p>It was a bag that he held, untying its mouth, and his
hand was now in it. He drew out pieces of varied shapes,
looking at them and rubbing them with his fingers.
"The faces of kings are on them," he said. "Runes of the
southlands. I can read some, but all I cannot read.
May the gods guide the jarl to places where he will find
many like these and bring them to me. He careth not
for them himself."</p>

<p>Hilda, standing in the doorway, grew sad and wistful
in the face. "Gone," she said. "Gone beyond seeing
or hearing. And I love him so! He is my hero! My
beautiful one! I am old, and I am soon to pass away,
and I know not clearly whither I go. Sometimes I would
that one of the gods might come and tell what things
there are in those countries for such as I am."</p>

<p>Then turned she and went back to her great chair by
the fire; but Ulric also was thinking of her and of Oswald,
for he said to Tostig and Wulf and those who were
with them, under the after deck: "The tongues of the
south folk? We do well to talk about them. My father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
knew many. Oswald, the harper, and Hilda could speak
with him in all of them and they had more that he knew
not. She hath learned much in her hundred years, and
she is not like other women. When I was a child, and
afterward, in the long winter evenings, when we had
naught else to do, I loved to have them teach me, and they
said it would be my need some day. I can talk with a
Briton or a Roman or a Greek. But Hilda and Oswald
taught me many words of a tongue that belongeth to a
people who live on the easterly shore of the Middle Sea.
They are a trading folk, and our sea kings found them
everywhere. They are not like other folk, and they have
a god of their own, but none of them can tell what he is
like. I have thought I would wish to see him, but Hilda
sayeth that he will not come out of his own country.
And that, too, is much the same with our own gods; but I
wish they may go with us now, for some of these southland
gods are cunning and strong."</p>

<p>"Not as are the gods of the North," said Tostig,
sturdily. "I too have heard of these Jews and their god,
but I do not care to see either him or any other god. It
is more than enough for me when I hear them whispering
across the fiords."</p>

<p>"So!" exclaimed Wulf the Skater. "I have been out
far on the ice, when there was no wind and there was a
bright moon, and I have gone landward with speed lest
their voices should overtake me. I heard them loudly
once, and that night I was chased by many wolves. I
slew some, but I stopped not for their skins, for the rest
were an army."</p>

<p>"Glad am I," said Ulric, "that if I meet one of these
gods I can speak to him fairly well in his own tongue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
How else, for instance, could I question this Jew god?
We shall sail all around the coasts of the Middle Sea before
we come home."</p>

<p>"What couldst thou ask him?" replied Knud. "And
what thinkest thou he might tell thee?"</p>

<p>"One thing that Hilda knew not," said Ulric. "I am
curious if the gods of those lands know the gods of the
North. I would know if this Jew god hath ever met
with Odin and Thor, and whether or not they are friends.
If they have fights, as do our own gods, which of them is
the stronger? I have thought that if I were a god, I
would bring all the others under me. It is not managed
well."</p>

<p>"I would not have land gods meddling too much with
the sea, save in battles," said Tostig. "It is well as it is.
But the Middle Sea is wide; we may not look upon all of
its coasts. There are deep bays and many islands."</p>

<p>"They say," responded Ulric, "that there is an open
water leading southward, and that if one can find it and
will sail into it boldly, fearing nothing, he may follow its
leading until he shall find the city of Asgard and the
home of the gods. Moreover, there are lands which no
foot hath trodden. I would see some of them if they are
to be found by sailing not too far."</p>

<p>So said they all, and there were other tales to tell concerning
seas and lands.</p>

<p>They still were talking of these things when a loud
shout from one of the watchers summoned them, and they
rushed out to the gunwales and the decks. The rain was
no longer falling and the sky was clear, so that they saw
well what was doing. The ice king had not at all lost his
grip upon his own floes, but southward was a vast rift in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the ice pack. Wide and blue was the open water, but it
was not very near them, and as they were looking at it
from their icy anchorage the watcher shouted again:</p>

<p>"O Ulric the Jarl, whales! They will come up again
from under the floes. I saw them. A great herd!"</p>

<p>Loud voices replied, inquiring, but they ceased, for the
herd quickly showed itself. Many and huge were the
whales that emerged, and some of them sprang half their
length out of the water.</p>

<p>"They are pursued!" exclaimed Knud the Bear. "I
have seen them spring in that manner when the swordfish
troubled them. But see them flounder now!"</p>

<p>Strange indeed was the confusion and the tumbling
about of this herd of the sea. They were beating the
waves into foam, and they were plunging hither and
thither as if wildly affrighted.</p>

<p>"I think that it is neither the swordfish nor the
thrasher," said Tostig the Red, for he had halfway
climbed the mast and he was leaning out to see. "O jarl,
it is one of the monsters that Hilda hath told us of. She
sayeth that only a few are left, for the gods destroyed
them lest they should eat up all the whales. Look
yonder!"</p>

<p>They were near enough to see, but could not note clearly
until a great fragment broke away from the field of ice
which carried <i>The Sword</i>. Through that chasm at its
outer border there came up a shape which was not the
head of a whale. It was long, with vast jaws, and in
them were pointed saws of long white teeth, with which it
tore terribly the side of a tremendous bull whale that was
nearest. But the bull whale turned and fought him, and
there was a vast whirling of foamy water, as the two sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
creatures struggled against each other, beating with heads
and fins and tails, but the vikings could none the better
discern the form of the whale's enemy.</p>

<p>"He is a comrade of the ice king," said Wulf the Skater.
"Never before was he seen in these waters. He is somewhat
like a snake, but with a vast belly. I saw his head
once before, long ago. Ten more were with me in the
ship, and we had been long storm-driven. The old men
told me much about him."</p>

<p>"He could upset a ship," said Tostig. "I am glad we
are here on the ice. But thou mayest have seen another
like him."</p>

<p>"Not so said the old men," replied Wulf. "He is
alone. There! He showeth again!"</p>

<p>"I am glad we have seen him," said Ulric. "But I am
more troubled concerning the ice king. See ye not that
he is fast melting? I have thought that he is beginning
to lean this way. We are drifting, truly, but we do not
get away from him. We are his prisoners."</p>

<p>They well understood that there might be deadly peril
for them in aught that should change the position of the
iceberg, but there was naught that they could do, even if
sure death were coming. So they preferred to gaze after
the herd of whales, and every now and then they thought
that they caught fresh glimpses of the monster from the
under sea, the terror of all other monsters. Few of them
but had heard and could tell old sagas of such creatures,
the remnants of the forgotten days, and they agreed that
this one was the world-snake that Hilda had sung of as
the destroyer.</p>

<p>"He eateth men joyfully," said one, "when he can get
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hilda said," replied Ulric, "that he cometh among
men no more. He cannot live in any sea that is plowed
by the keels of ships. The gods are against him. But
now the whales have fled and he hath followed."</p>

<p>Then turned they to stare at the ice king, and he seemed
as strong as ever. Far away at his right they saw the
bears, walking to and fro, and the wind brought from
them a sound as if they were moaning.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Fall of the Ice King.</small></span></h2>


<p>When the sun arose upon the fifth day of the week,
the day of Thor, the glittering pinnacles of the ice king
still towered high above the floes, and these covered the
sea as far as the eye could reach. All the white mass was
evidently in motion and the drifting was rapid, but it
seemed to the vikings as if their danger were striving to
push nearer to the ship. She was now lying almost
within his reach, if he should choose to strike her&mdash;and
she was but a very small thing. Her crew, going and coming
around her, were but so many specks upon the ice.
From her masthead still fluttered bravely out her White
Horse banner, and she was yet altogether unharmed, but
the rowers were at their places continually.</p>

<p>A prudent captain was the jarl, for, although the men
were impatient, he forbade their going far from the ship.
He held them back even when the remaining white bears
appeared near the feet of the ice king.</p>

<p>Knud was almost angry that he was not permitted to
go forth and slay them.</p>

<p>"One man for each bear, Ulric the Jarl," he said. "It
is our right. We may not ever meet them again, and the
chance for honor were lost. Thou hast won thy pair of
claws."</p>

<p>"Thou hast slain bears enough," said Ulric. "Were I
to let thee go, thou mightest perchance be left behind on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the ice, or under it. Small honor in that. I promise thee
the next chance to get thyself killed fairly."</p>

<p>"I obey," growled the grim old hunter, "for thou art
my jarl. But when we return from this cruise I will go
with Wulf the Skater into the winter of long night and
we will find them there. I will not go to Valhalla until
I have slain one as large as thine."</p>

<p>"Mind not thy bears now," responded Ulric. "Seest
thou not? Art thou blind?"</p>

<p>He blew his horn sharply, and all who were on the ice
around the ship sprang on board in haste.</p>

<p>"Mark!" he shouted. "Between us and the foot of the
ice king there is a chasm that widens. We know not
when the field may break away. Then he will be upon
us. Every man at his place this day!"</p>

<p>They who saw could understand, and there was no
more talk of hunting. Even when a white fox came and
looked at them, within bowshot, no arrow went after him.</p>

<p>"Let him go free," said Tostig. "He hath wild fowl
enough for the catching, but he will swim far before he
runneth on land again."</p>

<p>It was a time of doubt and of waiting, but the drifting
ceased not. There was much discussion at intervals,
among even the elder seamen, as to precisely in what part
of the sea they now might be, for there were no guidings.
Toward the sunset, after long hours of idleness that
brought weariness, Ulric went and stood by the hammer
of Thor on the fore deck. Tostig the Red came and stood
by him and laid his hand upon the hammer, for Tostig
was a smith, as had been his fathers before him. Not
only could he smelt iron out of the right rock, but he
could harden it for cutting and for bending and springing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
The secret of that art was his inheritance, and Hilda had
said that it was a thing that the old gods who were dead
had brought with them from the east before Asa Thor's
time. It was from a rising-sun land, but a cold one, that
Odin led his children, said some, and there were runes on
the rocks to prove it, if they might be read by any now
living.</p>

<p>"We go faster," said Tostig. "We have already gone
far this day. If the gods were against us, I think they
would not so swiftly bear us forward without wind or
work."</p>

<p>"Who knoweth the will of the gods?" replied Ulric.
"Not thou or I. They puzzle me greatly. I would they
might come at times and show themselves. How can one
know what to think of a god he hath never seen! I mean to
look upon one of them, if I may, before I sail back to the
Northland. That were a thing worth telling of a winter
evening by the fire in the hall."</p>

<p>"And have all men answer thee that thou wert lying?"
laughed Knud cheerily, from behind Tostig. "I believe
that Hilda seeth them at an hour that cometh to her, but
I would rather let them alone. I will think well of them
if they will but shove us along in the right direction.
They work finely now, it seemeth, but the sun goeth
down. Thor hath been friendly to us during all his day,
but I doubt if we are as safe after he is gone. The morrow
will be Freya's day, and she meddleth not overmuch
with seafaring matters. Ægir is the god of the sea, and
of him we know but little, nor of Ran, his wife, nor of his
nine daughters. They must at this hour be all under the
ice doing nothing."</p>

<p>The saying of Knud was a thing that it was hard to dispute,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>but it was in Ulric's mind to wonder whether or not
he and his vikings were drifting altogether beyond the
help of the old gods of the North.</p>

<p>The wind began to blow strongly, and the men listened
with eager ears, for they thought that they could now and
then hear shrill and angry voices from the neighborhood
of the ice king. Some of them were like shrieks, but
these may have been made by the gale itself, blowing
among the crags and chasms.</p>

<p>"We will both eat and drink," commanded Ulric. "Let
every man be hearty, that he may have his full strength
for that which may be before him."</p>

<p>After he himself had eaten he went to the after deck,
putting his hand upon the tiller. From that place he
might best watch the ice king, and there came others to
stand with him, waiting.</p>

<p>"He is very tall," said Ulric, at last. "I doubt if we
shall ever look upon his like again. But saw ye ever such
moonlight? I have known days when I could not see so
well as I can this night."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Wulf. "I know this moon. It is not such
light as ours, for he hath brought it with him. It is the
light which the gods make instead of sunlight in his own
place, and it will not go south any further than he goeth.
But mark the bears!"</p>

<p>"Something troubleth them," said Ulric.</p>

<p>All could see them plainly, and they were like ghosts
wandering to and fro among the rugged heaps of the ice
floes. They were much scattered and they moved as if
they were hunting for something which they could not
find, and they were calling often to each other, moaning
as if they were in pain or in great discontent. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
as they did so they lifted up their heads toward the moon,
but oftener toward the ice king.</p>

<p>"Look at him now!" exclaimed Ulric. "The moon is
shining upon him wonderfully.</p>

<p>"It is so," said Tostig, "but I think not of that. Wilt
thou note this, that whenever there cometh a boom of
the rending ice the bears call out to their mates? More
than we do they know of such matters. All such creatures
have gods of their own, and we may have offended
them. I like it not."</p>

<p>"The gods of the bears will care for the bears!" said
Knud. "They have naught to do with men."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was a time for men to speak softly
concerning such things when powers whom they saw not
and knew not were dragging them and their ship along so
helplessly. There are times when one feeleth that he can
get along well enough without the gods, but this was a
different matter. All the vikings talked soberly and they
were glad that their jarl was a son of Odin.</p>

<p>It was a strange, solemn, weird night in spite of the
moonlight, what with the peril and the moaning bears
and the booming ice. After all, they said, Odin himself
might not be with them. There had been places, as all
men knew, where all the gods had abandoned even the
bravest of the Northmen. Men like themselves had died
without a sword cut or a spear thrust. All hope of falling
in battle might be lost to them among these treacherous
ice floes. It was a short night, if there had been
aught to measure it by, but to the men on <i>The Sword</i> it
seemed long enough. None cared to go under a deck,
but there were some who lay down and slept. The moon
sank lower and lower and the shadows lengthened across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the ice fields, but there was yet a great flood of broken
light when Ulric, the son of Brander, uttered a loud cry
and put his war horn to his lips. Every man sprang to his
feet, for each thought that he had never before heard such
a blast as that. A louder sound instantly answered it, but
none could tell whether it came from among the ice peaks
or from down toward the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>"The bears are moaning again!" said Knud. He was
ever thinking of his bears, but all the rest were hearkening
for what might be coming next, and they knew not yet
the meaning of Ulric's blast.</p>

<p>"Oars!" shouted the jarl. "Every man to his place!
There is free water southerly. The ice king is bowing!"</p>

<p>Loudly moaned the bears, for a moment, and they
seemed to be running toward the ship, as if they would
come on board; and Ulric blew his horn again with the
notes of battle defiance, but then there burst out upon all
sides a roaring, splitting, rending sound, such as none
of the vikings had ever heard before.</p>

<p>"He hath struck! He is aground!" shouted Ulric.
"Hark to his breaking! His hour is come!"</p>

<p>If that were true, so also it seemed as if the hour of
<i>The Sword</i> had come, and of all who were on board
of her. But the gods were with her. If the forefoot of
the ice king had indeed caught upon a shoal, checking and
breaking him, the shock of that striking had separated the
great floe in front of him so that it might move freely.
Still it no longer upheld him, and he suddenly began to
pitch forward toward the ship. Vast was the roll of the
sea that swelled away from his pitching, and powerfully
it uplifted <i>The Sword</i> in her bed of ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold hard, all!" shouted Ulric. "Ready with your
oars! Odin!"</p>

<p>Up gazed they then, and the bravest of them shuddered,
for the gigantic white head of the ice king was
bowing nearer, as if he would cast himself upon them.
On rolled the great wave, steadily, and all along the crest
of it the ice it carried was rending into fragments that
ground angrily against each other. The floe that carried
<i>The Sword</i> became twain that parted, letting her down
and shooting her swiftly forward. It was just then that
the ice king fell upon his face, his uppermost pinnacle almost
crashing upon her stern.</p>

<p>The foaming water dashed across the deck and
drenched Ulric at the tiller. He was wearing no headpiece
now, and the salt spray drops glittered brightly
among his yellow curls. But they glistened not with
moonlight, for while they all had waited and watched the
sun had risen and his first rays lit the hero face of the son
of Odin as he shouted to his men to row their best, and as
he steered the good ship <i>The Sword</i> into the open water
the White Horse banner of the Saxons floated gallantly
from the masthead and men sprang to set free the sail.</p>

<p>"Hael, O Ulric the Jarl!" shouted Knud the Bear.
"We have a good sea captain."</p>

<p>So said several of the elder vikings.</p>

<p>"Hael, all!" cheerily responded Ulric. "The ice king
hath fallen and we shall fear him no more. The gods are
with us!"</p>

<p>Loudly shouted they all, and those who were not rowing
clashed their swords upon their shields as if they had
won a victory.</p>

<p>"Aye!" growled Tostig the Red. "'Tis a stout ship."</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<span class="smcap">The Living Sand.</span></h2>


<p>It was the time of thaw in the Northland, but the snow
and ice go fast when the winter letteth go its hold. Already
great reaches of land were bare, but no man might
travel far from his own home because of the floods from
the melting. All must wait until days should pass, and
these were growing longer, but they were full of unrest.
Even the cattle in their enclosures lowed impatiently to
one another; for the brute creatures know well the signs
of the return of green grass to their pastures. In the
house of Brander there was no shadow because of the
absence of any who had gone, but these were spoken of
cheerfully. Moreover, there came boats and larger keels
into the cove from other villages up and down the coast
and from out the fiords that were opening. Far and wide
had been known the building of <i>The Sword</i>, and many
would have been glad to look upon her. All these were
disappointed, but there were wise old vikings and jarls
of note who said to Hilda:</p>

<p>"Thy foster son hath done well. It is like his father.
Other keels will follow him speedily, but he will be first to
strike."</p>

<p>As if she had been mistress of the house was Hilda, and
she entertained well all who came. Reverence was paid
her because of her high descent and her kinship to Odin
the Strong, and because of her hundred winters, but even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
more because of her learning and her knowledge of the
gods. Men asked her questions concerning them, and
there were those who believed that she had seen and
known more than she would tell.</p>

<p>"I would not like to anger her," said one, "lest she
might afterward come to me in a bad hour, for she hath
knowledge of charms and of witchcraft and she can write
runes."</p>

<p>There was reason in that, said all, but that she was a
kindly woman and that she kept the house of Brander
liberally.</p>

<p>Much time she now spent among the old armor, the
trophies on the wall, and in the study of such things as
had been brought from the lands around the Middle Sea.
She made Oswald open his bag and she read the many
inscriptions upon his coins, and she talked to him of
Greece and of Rome, where most of them were made.
He also knew about his gold and silver pieces, and there
were some even of copper for which he had names and
values. What good was there in such things in a land
like this, where money was not needed?</p>

<p>"I would that Ulric had them," she said. "He might
buy with them another ship, or provisions, or arms."</p>

<p>"Not save of a friend," replied Oswald. "He will
need nothing that his sword can win for him. It is not
the custom of the vikings to be long in need."</p>

<p>The household knew by her face that her thoughts were
not troubling her concerning Ulric and his men.</p>

<p>"She hath had no ill token," they said. "It must be
that he doeth well."</p>

<p>They knew not of the ice king, nor how narrowly
he had missed his last angry blow at <i>The Sword</i>. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that peril was over and the good ship was flying along in
safety, driven by strong rowers, who had also some help
from the sail. They would have had more but that the
winds were variable. Therefore the days and the nights
went by before they again saw land, and the older seamen
knew by that that they had kept in the open sea and were
well advanced in their voyage.</p>

<p>"How fast or how far the ice king bore us I know not,"
said Knud the Bear, "but if that headland were not of one
of the northern isles, we have seen a cape of North
Britain."</p>

<p>"Not so far south as that," argued Tostig the Red,
"but all these coasts are bad to land upon. There is
naught worth the taking away."</p>

<p>"Our errand is not to them," said Ulric. "We will not
waste an arrow upon them. I will not let the prow of
<i>The Sword</i> touch the sand until we see the mid-coast of
the British island&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We shall see a storm this night," interrupted an old
viking. "The wind changeth to the northwest, and
Knud may wear his bearskins. It will be cold."</p>

<p>When the night fell all were willing to cover well; but
the rowers might rest, for the ship carried her sail all the
more safely because it was not too large and because she
was well laden. There was a spirit upon Ulric which
kept him at the helm, so that his men needed almost to
take him away by force that he might sleep.</p>

<p>"I would I might see Hilda and have speech with her,"
he said to himself. "I have strange dreams when I close
my eyes. She might tell me what they mean. Do the
gods come to one when he is asleep? I have heard so.
But they have told me nothing&mdash;save that I have dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of men who wore the armor that hangeth behind the table
on the dais. Strong men they were, and dark, and I
think they were good swordsmen. Before long it may
chance that we shall meet a trireme of the Romans if my
dreams have that reading. I must burn one of their ships
before we pass these seas."</p>

<p>Heavier blew the gale and higher rose the waves, and
<i>The Sword</i> sped on as if she were a waterfowl, but all
on board were willing to be as well covered as was Knud
the Bear. The night was dark and the next morning
they saw no land. The storm drove them onward
steadily all day, and now and then they saw ice floating,
but no sail of any ship. Again the night came, and the
moon was out and the wind lulled, but the waves were
still rough.</p>

<p>"We will not row," said Ulric, when they inquired of
him. "There are coasts now not far away. When the
dawn cometh we will seek some bay or harbor. I have
heard that there are villages of North folk hereaway, and
they would be friendly."</p>

<p>So said they all save Tostig the Red, who laughed
somewhat grimly and replied:</p>

<p>"I think there are villages upon many coasts whereof
the folk are willing to be friendly to a crew like this. The
seax hath many acquaintances who are willing to see him
stay quietly in the belt."</p>

<p>"So hath the ax," growled old Biorn the Berserker. It
was rare for him to speak, but he was leaning upon the
long handle of his weapon, and when he lay down on the
deck the ax slept beside him.</p>

<p>It was after the middle watch that night, and Ulric was
at the helm. He was steering a straight course south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ward
and the ship was slipping quietly over the waves.
He was awake, truly, but somehow he seemed to himself
to be dreaming almost, and his eyes were downcast.
"The runes upon the sand," he muttered. "I can see
them now, before the wave washed them away. When
and where am I to see them again, and to know that my
voyage is ended? Who shall read runes, and how shall
I be sure that I am not mistaken? For Hilda will not be
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there came to his ears a sound, and he
looked suddenly up, gripping hard the tiller.</p>

<p>"Faint and far away," he exclaimed, "but it was a
trumpet! There are three in the hall at the house and
Oswald taught me their soundings. Up, all! Rowers
to the oars! I will send an answer!"</p>

<p>Long and powerful was the horn blast that went out
across the moonlit sea. Clearer and louder than before
was the trumpet voice which instantly responded from the
right&mdash;and that was toward the British shore. The men
shouted not, for they were listening, and those who knew
were telling the younger vikings that the jarl had heard
from the Romans. It was good news to hear, after long
waiting, and the rowers put out the long oars eagerly.</p>

<p>"The dawn draweth near," shouted Ulric, after blowing
his horn again. "We will steer toward yonder trumpet.
There will be much music with the sun's rising.
We will see if the gods of Rome are better than the gods
of the North in the seas of Britain."</p>

<p>Loud voices answered him bidding him lead on; for the
blood of the vikings was rising hotly, and Biorn the Berserker
sharpened the edge of his great ax while he beat
the deck with his feet and out through his thickly bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
lips there poured, low, but swelling, a song of the skalds
at the gate of battle.</p>

<p>Red grew the edges of the eastern sky as <i>The Sword</i>
pressed her iron beak to the crests of the waves and
sprang forward. Joyously rang out the war horn of
warrior after warrior, for on board were vikings of high
descent who would not have chosen for their jarl any of
less degree than a son of Odin. They were men entitled
to go forward into the feast of swords shoulder to shoulder
with kings and with chiefs of renown. Said one of
them to Ulric:</p>

<p>"Jarl Ulric, many spears from the stowage. The
Romans cast well and their spears are heavy. I mind not
their light javelins nor their arrows. Close not with any
trireme at the first."</p>

<p>"I will be prudent," replied Ulric; "but bring out the
spears. There are arrow sheaves enough and stones for
slinging."</p>

<p>"Let them not ram <i>The Sword</i>," continued the old
fighter. "Her ribs are strong, but so is the beak of a war
galley of Rome. Strike her not save amidships."</p>

<p>Well was it for older men to counsel so young a leader,
but Ulric had been taught from his infancy not only by
Brander the Brave and Oswald, but by all the sea kings
and berserkers to whom he had listened while they talked
of war around the mid-fire in the old hall. Naught had
they said or sung but he had made its teachings his own
against an hour like this.</p>

<p>"A trireme!" shouted Knud the Bear as the daylight
brightened. "She is of the largest. Helmets and standards
and the shields of a cohort of a legion. They are
more in number than we are."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>"Twice more," said the old counselor, "and her bulk
is nearly thrice that of <i>The Sword</i>. Beware, O jarl!"</p>

<p>"I see her well," responded Ulric. "She is heavy in
the water. I think she is overburdened."</p>

<p>"They are swift also," said Tostig the Red, "but that
keel cannot turn as nimbly as can our own. Let us go
nearer!"</p>

<p>"Within a spear's cast!" shouted Ulric, fiercely. "We
will not pass her without a blow. Wulf, take thou the
helm. I will go to the fore deck."</p>

<p>There he stood in the morning light, as the two keels
neared each other. The Roman trumpets sounded at
intervals, and they were answered by the war horns of the
vikings.</p>

<p>"She is a splendid war vessel," said Ulric to those who
were with him. "Never yet have we builded her like.
Her bulwarks are higher than ours and her sail is many
times broader. It is made of woven stuff. Her prow is
a ram. We must not let her strike us."</p>

<p>"Neither will we strike her," said Biorn the Berserker,
"unless we can hit her amidships. She is a danger. O
jarl, beware! I do not think we may take that trireme,
but we can get away from her."</p>

<p>So did not think the trierarch and the centurion on
board the trireme. He who was captain of the vessel
was of one accord with the officer in charge of the legionaries
whom she was conveying. If Ulric could have
heard them converse as <i>The Sword</i> came toward them, he
would have learned somewhat of the estimation in which
such as he were held by the wolves of Rome.</p>

<p>"A Saxon pirate, O Lentulus," said the trierarch to
the man in armor at his side. "It is early in the season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
for them to be seen in these waters. They are the
scourges of the sea."</p>

<p>"And of the shore, friend Comus," replied the centurion.
"We will make short work of this one. It is of
good size, and it swarmeth with men as with bees."</p>

<p>"Hast thou ever met them in fight?" asked Comus, "or
is this thy first sight of them?"</p>

<p>"This is my first service in these waters," replied Lentulus,
"but I have heard much of them. I would we had
some legions of them to send against the Parthians, or
into Africa. Laurentius had a cohort of them with him
in Spain. They make the best of gladiators; Cæsar hath
used them in the arena. But it is hard to take them. Let us
see if we cannot send him a present of these pirates for the
summer games. He is ever in need of good swordsmen."</p>

<p>"Little thou knowest of them," laughed Comus. "We
may capture a few wounded men. The rest will die
fighting."</p>

<p>Even while he spoke Tostig the Red was remarking to
his friends at the stern of <i>The Sword</i>, just forward of the
deck: "A fine stone for my sling is this. I will strike that
high-crested one. There is often much treasure on a
trireme, if Thor will let us take her. But the men we
want not, nor the keel."</p>

<p>"Burn her," they said, "and throw the soldiers overboard;
but the Romans die where they stand. We shall
take no prisoners but the rowers. The jarl will slay
them." So without thought of mercy on either side did
the two keels draw nearer.</p>

<p>They were not yet within a spear's cast when they who
were with Tostig stood away from him to give him slinging
room. "He is the best slinger," they said, "on all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>North coast. Let us see what he can do. He is not a
boaster."</p>

<p>As the vessel climbed a wave Tostig poised himself,
swinging slowly the leathern thong which upheld the
square apron in which his pebble rested. Two pounds
only in weight it may have been, but it was smooth and
round from much chafing on the shore of the fiord with
other pebbles as the sea waves had tossed them to and fro
in many storms. Over the crest of the wave went <i>The
Sword</i>, and as she did so the sling began to whirl swiftly
in the hand of Tostig. Hand went to hand to give it
double force, and then, as the downward plunge of the
keel went with him, he gave his might to it and threw.</p>

<p>None saw the stone, so swiftly did it pass, but the
trierarch said to the centurion:</p>

<p>"O Lentulus, thou art said to be as good a spearman as
Pontius of Asia. Have thy pilum ready and try thy
fortune."</p>

<p>"It is too far," said Lentulus, poising his pilum. "I
was in battle once with that same Pontius. Hercules!
I am slain!"</p>

<p>Loud clanged his brazen helmet and prone he fell upon
the deck. He did not move again. The stone hurled by
Tostig had left him but life enough for that one outcry as
it smote him.</p>

<p>"May all the gods forbid!" exclaimed Comus. "What
ill fortune is this? He is dead! Toward the pirate!
Strike her through and through!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke a legionary at his side went down
before a second stone from the sling of Tostig, and the
shouts of the vikings mingled with the clangor of their
war horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Deft was the steering of Wulf and the swift rush of the
trireme was avoided, <i>The Sword</i> passing her stern so near
that every spearman might make a cast. But the legionaries,
pilum in hand, had faced the further bulwark,
thinking their foe came that way, and not so many of
them were at good stations. Their bowmen also had
been deceived, and their greater number was of no account.
Nevertheless, many Roman spears flew well,
being mostly of the lighter javelins used by them in the
beginning of a fight. Easily were these caught upon the
broad shields of the vikings, as if it were in a mere game
at home, and no harm was done by them or by the arrows.
Closer were they when they did their own throwing, and
a hundred heavy spears went hurtling in among the
legionaries.</p>

<p>"Follow!" shouted Comus. "Have ready the grapplings!
Strike and then board her!"</p>

<p>A good officer was he, and the rowers as well as the
legionaries obeyed him angrily, for they deemed the
Northmen insolent in assailing such superior force.</p>

<p>"Away!" shouted Ulric. "Hael to thee, O Tostig.
Get thee to the stern and pitch thy pebbles among her
rowers."</p>

<p>Tostig was toiling hard, and so were other good slingers,
of whom the trireme seemed to not have any, but <i>The
Sword</i> swept on out of range while her enemy was
turning.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Biorn, "she is not clumsy, but her steersman
went down. Let us gain what distance we may.
That was a good blow, but we may not strike the next so
easily."</p>

<p>The older vikings looked watchfully, as did Biorn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
again they said: "Our jarl is young, but this was well
done."</p>

<p>"Westward!" shouted Ulric to Wulf. "We must lead
them toward the land. I would I knew this coast."</p>

<p>"That do I," said Biorn, "if we are where I think.
There are high cliffs, but there is also much marsh land;
and off the coast there are great shallows, worse for a ship
than any rocks might be. Watch for them."</p>

<p>"They are our friends," said Ulric, "but they are not
friendly to a deep vessel like yonder trireme."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Biorn, "it is our old way of battling such
as she is, but there is an evil among these shallows. Hast
thou not heard of the sand that is alive? There is much
of it hereaway."</p>

<p>"My father warned me of it," replied Ulric. "If horse
or man setteth foot upon it, it will seize him and suck him
down. But it could not swallow a ship."</p>

<p>"Were she a mountain!" exclaimed Biorn. "The living
sand would be worse than a Roman trireme for <i>The
Sword</i> to escape from. Yonder is a land line at the sky's
edge, and I think I see breakers."</p>

<p>The rowers were rowing well and <i>The Sword</i> had
gained a long advantage before the Roman oarsmen had
recovered from their confusion. Now, however, Ulric
upon the foredeck was measuring distances, wave after
wave, and he spoke out plainly to his men.</p>

<p>"Swift is <i>The Sword</i>," he said. "I had thought that no
keel on earth could be swifter, but we are laden heavily;
so is the trireme, that she turneth not nimbly, but in a
straight course she is swifter than are we. She hath
many rowers and she is sharp in the prow. She gaineth
upon us little by little."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Woe to her," responded the vikings. "She moveth
too fast for her good."</p>

<p>"The land riseth fast," said Biorn. "The breakers are
not far away. Under them are sand shoals."</p>

<p>"The Roman is but a hundred fathoms behind us," replied
Ulric. "Wulf the Skater, steer thou through the
breakers. Let us see if she will dare to follow."</p>

<p>Comus, the trierarch, was overeager, or he would
have remembered that which he seemed to have forgotten.
They who were with him were stung by the death of Lentulus
and by the ravages of the Saxon spears and stones.
None counseled him to prudence, and he dashed on in the
foaming wake of <i>The Sword</i>.</p>

<p>"Breakers, but no rocks," muttered Wulf, as he grasped
his tiller strongly. "Now, if we fill not, we shall dash
through. Pull! For the Northland pull!"</p>

<p>Hard strained the rowers. High sprang the curling
breakers on either hand. Loud rang the shouts and the
war horns. But <i>The Sword</i> rose buoyantly over the
crown of a great billow and passed on into smoother water.</p>

<p>"Odin!" roared Biorn the Berserker. "The trireme is
but fifty paces&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Struck!" shouted Ulric. "On, lest we ourselves may
be stranded!"</p>

<p>"Deep water here, Jarl Ulric," calmly responded an old
seaman near him. "We have passed the sand bar. It
may be the tide is falling. The gods of the sea are against
that Roman keel."</p>

<p>"Or they are not with her to-day," said Ulric.
"She is held fast. Cease rowing and put the sail up
again. We will see if there is aught else that we may do.
I like not to let her escape me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Up went the sail, and for an hour <i>The Sword</i> did but
cruise back and forth, only now and then venturing near
enough for the hurling of a stone or the sending of an arrow.
It was then too far for any harm to the Romans,
but they could hear the taunting music of the horns.</p>

<p>"Low tide," said Biorn at last, "and she lieth upon bare
sand. We are well away. We can do no more."</p>

<p>"Watch!" said Ulric. "They are troubled."</p>

<p>"She lieth too deeply. What is this?" So asked the
Roman seamen of their captain as they leaned over their
bulwarks and studied that bed of sand. He answered
not, but one, a legionary in full armor, stepped down from
the ship to examine more closely&mdash;and an unwise man
was he. In places the sandy level seemed firm enough,
and a horse may gallop along a sandy beach after the tide
is out and leave but a fair hoofprint. That way armies
have marched and chariots have driven. There were
other patches, however, whereon the sand seemed to
glisten and to change in the sunlight, and here there was
potent witchcraft working. At these had the sailors been
gazing, but the soldier did not reach one of them.</p>

<p>"Back!" shouted Comus. "It is the living sand! We
are all dead men! Back!"</p>

<p>The legionary strove to wheel at the word of command,
but his feet obeyed him not. Even the vikings were near
enough to see that the sand was over his ankles.</p>

<p>"The under gods have seized him," muttered Ulric.
"It is from them that the sand liveth. They are angry
with him.</p>

<p>"<i>Vale! Vale! Vale!</i>" shouted the legionary. "O
Comus, I go down! They who dwell below have decreed
this. See thou to the ship and follow not the Saxons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Follow them?" exclaimed Comus. "<i>Vale</i>, O comrade!
But the trireme lieth a handbreadth deeper. She
is sinking! O all the gods! Have we come to this ending?
Who shall deliver us?"</p>

<p>"None, O Comus," said a man of dark countenance
who leaned over the bulwark at his side. "We have offended
the gods and they have left us to our fate."</p>

<p>Lower sank the wooden walls of the great vessel, while
her helpless crew and the soldiery stared despairingly at
the pitiless sand and at the White Horse flag of the
vikings dancing lightly over the sea so near them.</p>

<p>"Form!" commanded Comus, and the legionaries fell
into ranks all over the vessel. "Put ye the body of Lentulus
upon the deck," he said, "and bring me the eagle of
the legion. O Lentulus, true comrade, brave friend, we
salute thee, for all we who were of thy company go down
to meet thee. Behold, we perish!"</p>

<p>Silent sat the rowers at their oars. The standards fluttered
in the wind. The trierarch took the eagle and
went and stood by the body of Lentulus.</p>

<p>"They are brave men, yonder," said Biorn the Berserker.
"They will to die in line. So do the Romans
conquer all others except the men of the North."</p>

<p>"They have one trireme the less," replied Tostig the
Red. "But they have many more. This is not like burning
one. I see no honor to us in this."</p>

<p>"Honor to the gods," said Ulric. "She was too strong
for us and Odin destroyed her."</p>

<p>"It is well to have him on our side," said Tostig; but
Knud the Bear laughed loudly, as was his wont, and said:
"Odin is not a sea god. What hath he to do with sand
and water? Some other god is hidden under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
living sand. We shall leave him behind us when we go
away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her bulwarks go under!" shouted one of the vikings.
"Hark to the trumpets! They go down!"</p>

<p>The trumpet blast ceased and there was a great silence,
for the like of this had never before been seen.</p>

<p>"Oars!" commanded Ulric. "We will search the
coast. Such a warship as was this came not hitherward
without an errand. She may have had companions."</p>

<p>The old vikings all agreed with him, and an eager lookout
was set, but behind them as they sailed away they saw
nothing but a bare bed of sand, over which the tide was
returning.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Saxon Shore.</small></span></h2>


<p>"O jarl!" exclaimed Knud the Bear, in a morning
watch, "we have wasted days in this coasting. The
weather hath been rough and the men are weary, for we
are tightly packed in this ship."</p>

<p>"No longer shouldst thou prevent us from seeking the
shore," said another. "I would hunt, and get me some
fresh meat." There were also voices of impatience and
of discontent among the crew.</p>

<p>The jarl listened, and thoughtfully he responded: "I
have not forgotten that the Romans sail in fleets. We
are one keel. If now we have avoided any trireme that
was company for the one which was swallowed by the
sand, we have done well. We will steer toward the
shore. My father told me of such a coast as this."</p>

<p>"As the sun riseth higher," said Biorn the Berserker, "I
think I can see a low headland. This is not my first
cruising in these seas."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the jarl. "We will go within the
headland. If we find a good shore, we will land, for I
am of one mind with you."</p>

<p>All the older vikings approved of his prudence, for they
knew the Romans better than did the younger warriors,
full of eagerness. Even now the sailing of <i>The Sword</i>
was with caution. The noon drew near and they were
close to the headland. It was neither high nor rocky, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
on it was a forest; but here was a surprise, for the trees
growing down to the beach were in full leaf.</p>

<p>"The winter tarried late in the Northland," said the
vikings. "We have also been many days upon our way.
The summer is near."</p>

<p>They might also discern patches of green grass, and
now Knud shouted from the fore deck: "A deep cove, O
jarl! It is very deep."</p>

<p>Ulric was at the helm, and he responded: "Thou hast
good eyes, O Bear. Watch thou for rocks and shoals and
give me word. Let all eyes watch also for boats or
men."</p>

<p>The rowers rowed easily and <i>The Sword</i> slipped on
into the cove. Here was dense forest on either side, and
there were rocks, but the trees were large and old and
there seemed to be little undergrowth, nor was there any
sign of the dwellings of men.</p>

<p>"The Britons," said an old viking, "build not often on
the shore. They are not seamen. They have no forts
but wooden palisades, and they dwell inland, where they
are more safe. They fight well, but they have little
armor, and their steel is soft. They are no match for the
legions of Rome."</p>

<p>It was exceedingly still as <i>The Sword</i> went forward.
Away at the left a herd of red deer came out under a
vast oak and stared at the newcomers. At their head was
a stag with branching antlers.</p>

<p>"Now know we," said Biorn the Berserker, "that no
men are near this place, for these creatures are exceedingly
timid. But their venison is of the best. In Britain
are also wild cattle in abundance, and wild swine. We
will have great hunting before we sail to other places."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Swiftly away sped the red deer, for the prow of <i>The
Sword</i> touched the strand and Wulf the Skater sprang
ashore, followed by a score of vikings.</p>

<p>"On, up the bank!" shouted the jarl. "Return and
tell what thou seest. All to the shore and stand ready if
he findeth an enemy."</p>

<p>"A prudent jarl," murmured Biorn the Berserker. "He
will not be surprised."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the younger men laughed scornfully, for
they liked not well the hard discipline of the jarl, and he
brooked no manner of disobedience, as was his right.</p>

<p>Back came one from Wulf the Skater. "O jarl!" he
shouted. "A fine spring of water. An open glade.
Wulf asketh if he shall now cut the saplings."</p>

<p>"I come soon," replied the jarl, "but cut stakes for a
palisade leading down to this beach on either hand.
Though there be no Romans here, there are Britons not
far off."</p>

<p>Axes were plying speedily, and while the first fires were
kindling many sharp stakes were driven, to be woven between
with flexible twigs and branches. Such was ever
the custom of the Saxons upon a new land, for behind
such a wattle-work defense a few warriors may withstand
many, and light palisades guard well against horsemen.
Not all could work in these matters, and twoscore were
selected by lot for the first hunting, going out in four
parties, with a command not to venture too far. They
were bowmen, but they went in their armor. Before the
sun set there was a good stockade from tree to tree
around the spring, with arms that reached out on either
hand almost to the shore.</p>

<p>"We will make it stronger," said the jarl, "but behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
it we are safe; for we might also retreat to the ship if
there were need."</p>

<p>No red deer save one stag and a doe did the hunters
bring in, and there would have been a lack of meat but
for the slaying by another party of four black cattle, fat
and good.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said the men. "Did we not tell thee? This
is better than being packed so tightly in <i>The Sword</i>.
This is good venison."</p>

<p>Well contented was he also, and he saw that he must
humor the men if he were to command them well thereafter.
For this reason, therefore, other and larger hunting
parties went out the next day, and they came home
heavily laden.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Tostig the Red, for his party, "we have
also found paths, but no men. We saw hills beyond, but
a river is between us and them, and a great marsh. I
think no Britons come hither across the marsh."</p>

<p>"On the morrow I will go," said Ulric. "I will leave
Biorn in command of the camp. I have no need for
hunting, but I must know the land."</p>

<p>Barrels of ale had been brought to the shore, and that
night was a feast, with songs and sagas. After the feast
the jarl went and lay down to sleep under an oak, but
his eyes would not close for thinking of the Northland,
and of the Middle Sea, and of Asgard.</p>

<p>"This landing is well," he thought, "and I am glad to
be in Britain. But here I may not linger too long. O
Hilda of the hundred years, not yet hast thou visited me.
I wonder if thou or the gods could find me this night
under this oak tree. Who should tell thee where to come
if thou wert seeking me? The gods see everywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Biorn sayeth that the gods of Britain are gods of the
woods, and we are from the sea. I care not much for
wood gods."</p>

<p>Then he rested, but he arose early and chose the men
who were to go with him.</p>

<p>"Guide me to the river and the marsh," he said to Wulf
the Skater.</p>

<p>"I will, O jarl," said Wulf; "but Tostig saw a wild
boar yesterday and he hath gone out after him. A vast
one, he sayeth, with tusks like a walrus. He will fight
well if they can bring him to a fighting."</p>

<p>"Let Tostig win his boar," said Ulric. "We go to the
left and we hunt not. I am full of thoughts about this
place."</p>

<p>A score of vikings were with them, and they marched
on in order, two and two, as if they had an errand.
Grand were the trees, and high, with branches whose
foliage made a gloom to walk in.</p>

<p>"Are we nearly at the marsh?" asked Ulric at last.
"Here are rocks."</p>

<p>"I know not, O jarl," said Wulf. "We came not so
far southerly yesterday."</p>

<p>"Hael, Northmen! Hael! But sound no horn! Who
are ye?"</p>

<p>As if he had suddenly arisen through the ledge of rocks
before them, upon it stood a tall shape in full armor, spear
in hand. From under his helmet tangled white hair fell
down to his shoulders, but his right hand, holding the
spear, was lifted as by one who giveth a command.</p>

<p>Again he spoke: "I am Olaf, the son of Hakon, of
Droningsfiord. Who are ye?"</p>

<p>"Northmen of thine own land," said the jarl. "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Ulric, the son of Brander. Our ship, <i>The Sword</i>, lieth at
the shore. How camest thou where thou art, and who is
with thee?"</p>

<p>"None are with me," said Olaf, sternly. "We were
many, but the Romans have smitten the Saxon shore of
Britain and our villages are gone. They have smitten
many of the Britons also, and they march to smite them
again this day. Tell me, O Jarl Ulric, hast thou seen
aught of certain triremes which were to come? I would
know if there are more Romans near than I have already
counted."</p>

<p>"One hath perished, as I will shortly tell thee," said
Ulric. "I have seen no other."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Olaf. "There floateth one in a harbor
not far away, but they who came in her are fewer than
when they landed. Twain came, with a cohort. One
hath sailed. Their force was sent to slaughter the Druids
at their great sacrificing, but first they struck our village
at our harbor. We fought, but they were too many. I
cut my way through the ranks of their lighter spearmen,
and they followed me not far because of the nearness of
the Britons."</p>

<p>Olaf was now descended from the rock and was become
as one of them. Great was his wonder at the story of the
living sand and the trireme.</p>

<p>"The gods of the Britons are strong at times," he said,
"but they are not to be depended on. They have done
this because of the great sacrifice, that the Romans may
not hinder it. Therefore come thou with me a little distance
and I will show thee a matter. The Romans are
tangled in a wood. Meddle not thou and thine, however,
for thou hast another work to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"I meddle not," said the jarl, "but I thank these Druid
gods. We were closely pushed and in peril when they
ensnared the trireme with their sand. I will offend them
not, but I would see these great sacrifices and I also would
offer my token."</p>

<p>"That the Druids will forbid thee," said Olaf. "Follow
me quickly to the crown of this ridge, for it is on the
bank of the river."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there came to their ears a clangor of
trumpets, as if many sounded at once.</p>

<p>"Romans!" exclaimed Ulric.</p>

<p>"Sounding first were they," said Olaf, "but these
hoarse ones, very loud, are blown by the Druids. Hear,
also, the harping. Now look thou, for thou art a captain."</p>

<p>The river before them was but narrow, although it
might be deep, and on the other side was a broad open
space surrounded by a forest with dense undergrowths of
bushes, as if it were marshy. In the open was arrayed a
cohort of Roman soldiers, well ordered, but beyond and
in their front might be seen and heard much larger numbers
of such as they were, all disarrayed and scattered by
the copses. None assailed the cohort in the open, but all
the forest swarmed with half-armed Britons, hurling
darts and plying their light blades. Arrows, also, were
flying, and there was a great tumult of mingled sound.</p>

<p>"The men in white robes, keeping afar," said Olaf, "are
the Druid priests. This is as an ambush, and the Romans
are falling."</p>

<p>"Their commander hath some wisdom, I think," said
Ulric. "His trumpets call back his men for a retreat.
He will escape."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"He loseth half his force," said Olaf; "he will lose
more as he retreateth."</p>

<p>Fiercer and fiercer arose the sounds of the combat, the
shouting, the howling, the twanging of loud harp strings,
and the braying of the trumpets. Hard was it for the
vikings that they might not have a part in such a battle.</p>

<p>"The Romans are outnumbered," said Olaf, "but they
fight well. Their retreat will be to the river mouth,
where was my village. There have they a camp in our
own stockade, and they have also increased it with a rampart
of earth and palisades. There we must strike them.
It is but a little distance. Come and see."</p>

<p>"But first," said Ulric, "I would see the end of this battle,
and I would have speech with a Druid concerning the
sacrifices."</p>

<p>"That thou mayest not this day," said Olaf, "and the
Romans are cutting their way through the tumult of half-naked
spearmen. Lo, how they slay the Britons! But
the ranks of their cohort will be thin when the remnant
reacheth the fort. So hath it often been in their warfare
in Britain, but each new commander of legionaries
cometh here a proud one, thinking only of easy victory."</p>

<p>"The darts fly in showers," said Ulric, but Wulf the
Skater urged him.</p>

<p>"O jarl!" he exclaimed. "The village! The fort!
The trireme! Why wait we here? Let us go with Olaf!"</p>

<p>The jarl answered not, but walked rapidly, and the
rocky ledge grew higher as they went; but there came an
end of it.</p>

<p>"We have walked far," said Ulric. "The way of the
Romans was shorter. There come they and their array is
not broken. I can see their commander ordering them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thor the Thunderer!" exclaimed Olaf, "what havoc
the Britons have made among them! The gods of the
Druids have protected their sacrifices."</p>

<p>"Every Roman left behind hath perished," said Ulric.
"Only these are alive."</p>

<p>"Not so," said Olaf. "Not a wounded man or one
entrapped hath been slain. He belongeth to the gods at
the place of sacrifice."</p>

<p>"With them as with us," said the jarl. "That is the
old North custom. I have seen men slain at the stone of
Odin. He who is captured must lose his head. It is
well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seest thou?" loudly demanded Olaf. "The ruins of
our village are yet smoking, although three days have
passed. I saw thy ship on the sea yesterday, but knew
not of thy landing. I meant to watch for thee or for the
coming triremes after seeing the battle."</p>

<p>"Yonder trireme at anchor," replied the jarl, "floateth
well out from the river mouth. She is large. How shall
I take her? For there are yet Romans enough to hold her
well. I must come to her by night in <i>The Sword</i>."</p>

<p>Long and thoughtfully gazed Ulric, studying the position
of the trireme and the arrival of the beaten Romans
at the fort.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Biorn the Berserker, "knowest thou not
that I am a fish? The trireme is held but by an anchor
and a cord of hemp. Go thou and bring <i>The Sword</i>.
When thou art at hand to strike thou mayest have the
trireme drifting with the outgoing tide. Strike not when
the tide runneth in?</p>

<p>"Thou canst swim," said Ulric, "and thy seax will
sever hemp; but if thou waitest here until I come, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
wilt thou know in the dark of my coming, or how wilt
thou know where to ply the sharp edge?"</p>

<p>"When I hear thee whistle thrice," said Biorn, "as if
thou wert calling thy hawk, I will know of thy coming.
If the whistle is from this shore, I meet thee here. If it is
from seaward, I swim to the trireme. Thou wilt know
the hemp is severed when thou hearest my own falcon
call."</p>

<p>"I go with thee, O jarl!" shouted Olaf, eagerly, "that I
may be thy pilot."</p>

<p>"Well for thee, O Biorn the Berserker," said Ulric;
"thou art of the heroes!"</p>

<p>"Here sit I down," replied Biorn. "It is a pleasant
place. I think this taking of the trireme will depend
upon thee and thy sword more than upon a man a fish
cutting hemp!"</p>

<p>"Haste, now," said Ulric to his men. "<i>The Sword</i>
is far from us and this is to be a night of great deeds, and
not of ale and feasting."</p>

<p>Olaf led, as the guide of their rapid marching, and
Biorn sat down upon a rock to gaze at the doings around
the river mouth and at the fort.</p>

<p>"There come the Britons out of the woods," he said to
himself. "If they had been well led they would have
pursued more closely&mdash;only that few care to press too
hard upon even the wreck of a Roman army. Now are all
the Romans within the stockade."</p>

<p>The Britons were many, but their prey had escaped
them. The camp fort was too strong for them to storm,
and their showers of darts flew over the palisades without
much harm to any within. The taunting clangor of their
harps and trumpets sounded furiously for a while, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
then the multitude swiftly vanished as if it had melted
away.</p>

<p>"If these Britons had a captain," said Biorn, "instead
of a herd of priests, and if he would arm them well, the
Romans would disappear from Britain. But I think
Ulric the Jarl will find many swords on yonder trireme.
Even now they go out in small boats. Biorn the Berserker
will be with him when the Saxons are on the
Roman deck!"</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Taking of the Trireme.</small></span></h2>


<p>The night was at hand when the jarl and his party arrived
at the camp, and already all others were around the
camp-fires.</p>

<p>"O jarl!" shouted Tostig. "Come thou and see this
mighty one! We hauled him hither upon a bundle of
branches, and he wearied us with his weight."</p>

<p>"Never saw I such a one!" exclaimed Ulric, gazing at
the great boar which lay at the fire by the spring. "Was
he for thy spear alone?"</p>

<p>"For mine!" said Tostig. "Now am I even with thee
concerning the white bear, for this one fought as did the
son of the ice king. He nearly overcame me after he had
slain Nef, the son of Ponda, and had rent him in pieces.
He had no wound from Nef."</p>

<p>"We did watch them," said a viking, "and to Tostig is
the honor. If his spear had broken, as did thine in the
bear, I think Tostig would have lost the battle."</p>

<p>"Then had I felt those great tusks," laughed Tostig,
"But it will take all the night to roast him well."</p>

<p>"He will roast while we fight," replied the jarl; "and
some of us will eat not of him, but in Valhalla. To the
ship, all! We go to attack a Roman trireme. Let those
eat now who have not eaten, taking their meat with them.
I leave not a sword here!"</p>

<p>"He who would stay behind is nidering!" shouted Tos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>tig
the Red. "We will follow our jarl to the feast of
swords, and they who return may find the boar roasted.
Hael to thee, O jarl! Thou bringest good tidings."</p>

<p>Not until all were in the ship, however, did Ulric explain
to his men fully and carefully the errand upon
which they were going. Wild was their enthusiasm, and
once more the young and the discontented were satisfied
with their jarl.</p>

<p>"He is a son of the gods," they said, "and he will lead
us to victory."</p>

<p>"Or to Valhalla," growled Knud the Bear. "Not all of
you will eat the roasted boar's flesh."</p>

<p>The rowers rowed with power and <i>The Sword</i> went
swiftly. Ulric was at the helm, and Olaf was at the
prow sending back words of direction. The distance to
be traveled was less on the water than on the land,
through the forests.</p>

<p>"I would I knew of the doings of Biorn," said one, as
the ship rounded a point and entered the harbor at the
river mouth.</p>

<p>The jarl answered not, but shortly he put his fingers to
his lips and whistled thrice.</p>

<p>"Row slowly, now," he said, "till an answer shall come.
I am glad the moon is not yet arisen. We go on behind a
curtain."</p>

<p>The jarl's signal had been heard by a man upon whom
was only a belt, to which hung a sheathed seax and a war
horn. He stood at the water's edge at the harbor side.</p>

<p>"The jarl cometh!" he whispered, and he went into the
water, making no sound. Before that he had crept along
the shore, landward, bearing his arms and his armor, and
now he had but sixty paces to swim. The Roman senti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>nel
on the deck of the trireme heard only the ripple of the
outgoing tide against her wooden walls.</p>

<p>Knife upon hemp cutteth silently, but soon the sentinel
turned with a sharp exclamation, for out of the seaward
silence there came a long, vibrating whistle, another, another,
and then from the hollow of a dark wave near the
trireme there sounded a fourth like unto these three.
This last he answered with a shout, and he hurled his
pilum at that darkness in the water, but the trireme herself
responded with a lurch and a yawing as she began to
be swept away by the tide. There were rowers on board,
and they quickly sprang to the oars, but they were few
and there was yet no steersman. There were many
soldiers also, but their officer ordered a number of them to
the oars, that he might get the ship under control.
When, therefore, there came gliding swiftly out of the
shadows the unlooked-for warship of the Saxons she was
alongside and her grapplings were made fast with none to
hinder.</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the Roman vessel, as it were
from the water itself, now sounded furiously the war
horn of Biorn the Berserker. Full half of the legionaries
rushed in that direction and their hurled spears were too
hastily lost in the sea. Terribly rang out the war horns
and the battle shouts of the Saxons, but the first man of
them on board of the trireme was Ulric the Jarl, and
down before his ax fell whoever met him. Close behind
him were his followers, so that the nearer Romans were
not only surprised, but outnumbered.</p>

<p>Up the side, near the stern, climbed Biorn the Berserker,
and for a moment he was alone, so quickly had
fallen twain who were there. Taking in hand the helm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
"Biorn! Biorn the Berserker!" he shouted. "O jarl, I
am here! The ship is ours!" Hard fought the remaining
Romans, nevertheless, against such odds, but all the
rowers were slain at their oars.</p>

<p>"It is done!" said Ulric. "Silence, all! I have called
twice for Biorn. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"O jarl, son of Brander the Brave!" came faintly back
from the after deck, "hast thou fully taken this trireme?"</p>

<p>"We have her!" answered Ulric. "Thanks to thee, O
Biorn! She is thine!"</p>

<p>"Odin!" shouted back the old berserker. "Then bear
thou witness for me, at feast and in song, that Biorn, the
son of Nar, the sea king, died not by drowning, but by the
driven spear of a Roman, in all honor. I go to Valhalla
as becometh me. Rejoice, therefore, and smite thou
these Romans once more for me. I die!"</p>

<p>There was a silence of a moment on the ship, but then
the oldest viking of all blew triumphantly his horn and
shouted: "We have heard! Biorn, the hero, hath gone
to the hall of the heroes. He died by the spear, and not
a cow's death. Good is his fortune. Hael to thee, O
Biorn! And hael to Jarl Ulric, the leader of men."</p>

<p>Clashed loudly then the shields and spears, but already
Saxon hands were upon the oars and Tostig the Red was
at the helm, with Olaf by him. Only it might be a
dozen warriors had been named by the valkyrias to go
to Valhalla with Biorn the Berserker, but the Romans
whose bodies were cast into the sea were ten times as many.</p>

<p><i>The Sword</i> and the trireme were now going out with
the tide into the open sea and into the darkness, but there
had been much sounding of trumpets in the camp of the
Romans. Few as were the remaining legionaries, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
had marched to the shore ready for action. There were
small boats at the beach, but it was all too late for any
use of these. Those who patrolled and inquired, however,
found at the side of a rock a helmet like a bear's
head, a shirt the hide of a bear, two heavy spears, an ax&mdash;the
trophies to them of Biorn the Berserker. These were
brought to the centurion in command and he examined
them with care.</p>

<p>"The pirates of the North are here," he said. "Woe is
me that ever I came to this death coast! Here shall we
leave our bones, for the Britons will come like locusts,
and we have lost our trireme!"</p>

<p>"Another ship cometh soon," said his friends. "We
may hold the fort well until her arrival. All is not lost."</p>

<p>"Know ye that?" replied the centurion. "If the
trireme of Lentulus were above the water, she would have
arrived long since. He hath never failed an appointment.
I think it was his evil demon and not the favor of
the proconsul that made him the count of the Saxon
shore. The fates are against us."</p>

<p>So darkly brooded the Romans over their many disasters,
while Ulric the Jarl ordered the steering of his two
ships up the coast and into the cove where he had first
landed.</p>

<p>"I would have speech with a Druid, if I may," he said
to Olaf. "It is strongly upon my mind that I must see
this great sacrifice to their gods. Manage thou this
for me. Thou hast been in league with them."</p>

<p>"What I can do in such a matter I will do," said Olaf.
"But, O jarl, I have somewhat to say to thee concerning
this trireme. Consider her well, for she is a strong warship
and there is much room in her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Also much plunder," said Ulric; "but that must wait
for the day. Each man hath his share, and the shares
of the slain go to their kindred when we return."</p>

<p>"So is the North law," said Olaf; "but where shall any
man stow that which may be his prize? <i>The Sword</i> is
but a nutshell. Thou wilt think of this matter, for thou
art jarl."</p>

<p>The night waned toward the dawn and all had need of
rest. The ships were anchored, therefore, and the cove
was still.</p>

<p>The trumpets at the Roman camp greeted loudly the
sun's rising. The sentinels were changed and the patrols
came in from the edges of the forest to report that no
enemy seemed to be coming. The soldiers sullenly attended
to the customary morning duties of the camp, now
and then glancing seaward as if they hoped to see a sail.
The centurion in command walked along the lines of
his intrenchments, studying them, but his eyes more often
sought the earth. A stalwart man was he, in splendid
armor, and his face bore scars of battle. Well had he
fought the Britons the day before, but now he loudly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"O my imprudence! I should have waited for Lentulus
and a greater force. Will he never come? But, if
he come, the fault of this defeat is not his, but mine. He
will be acquitted, and I am left alone to account to Cæsar
for a lost eagle of a legion!"</p>

<p>He smote upon his breast and again he walked onward,
downcast and gloomy. Once more he spoke, with exceeding
bitterness:</p>

<p>"How shall I answer for the loss of the trireme here in
the bay? Will not all men say that I kept no watch?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>He stepped upon the rampart and stood still. Near at
hand were the ruins of the Saxon village, but they had
ceased smoking and lay black and bare as witnesses of the
ruthless blow which he had smitten upon the Northmen
of the Saxon shore. Beyond were fields which would
not be cultivated this season as formerly. There were
many corpses yet unburied, for the slayers had spared
none save boys and girls for the slave market. The very
young, the very old, even the middle-aged women, had
been slain, and the fighting men had fallen with their
weapons in their hands. The prisoners were guarded in
a kind of pen at the left, and they were many.</p>

<p>"Petronius," shouted the centurion to an officer of
rank, "take with thee ten and slay all. We have no conveyance
for them. Let not one escape."</p>

<p>One order was as another to a Roman soldier, and
Petronius answered not, but marched away into the
camp, seeking his ten who with him were to butcher the
prisoners.</p>

<p>"I am dishonored!" said the centurion. "Fate and fortune
are against me. I can give no reason for the loss of
the trireme. I will go down to the shades."</p>

<p>Slowly he drew his short-bladed, heavy gladius from
its sheath. He looked at it, trying its edge, and he
said:</p>

<p>"Thou hast been with me through many battles, O
sword! Thou hast drunk the blood of more lives than I
can count. Be thou true to me now, for all else is lost."</p>

<p>Then he knelt upon the rampart and placed the hilt
firmly in the earth, the blade point leaning toward him.
He braced himself and cast his weight with force. A
gasp, a shudder, a struggle of strong limbs, and Petronius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
was in command of the Roman camp, for his superior officer
was dead.</p>

<p>There were many screams at the prison pen, but afterward
all was quiet, and Petronius returned, to be told of
this new misfortune which had befallen.</p>

<p>"Keep ye good watch," he said, "lest the Britons take
us unawares. There is more than one trireme yet to
come. But now we will raise the funeral pile of him who
lieth here, for he died in all honor."</p>

<p>Orders were given and the soldiers brought much
wood, but they came and went in silence, for their fates
were dark before them.</p>

<p>So was it with the camp of the Romans; but at the
camp of the Saxons, at the cove and spring, there was
high feasting, for they found the wild boar well roasted
and the venison was abundant. They needed but harps
and harpers, for the spirit of song came upon all singers,
and it was a day of triumph. Not even the older vikings
could say that they had ever heard of the taking of a
Roman warship in this wise.</p>

<p>"Some have the sea kings rammed to sinking," they
said. "Some have they driven ashore and some have they
burned; but the Romans themselves ever burn any keel
that they are leaving. Hael to <i>The Sword</i>, the victor!"</p>

<p>"The smiters of my kindred have themselves been
smitten," said Olaf, the son of Hakon, but he sat with
a fierce fire burning in his eyes and his seax lay bare at his
side.</p>

<p>"We have smitten them upon the sea," said Ulric the
Jarl, "but not yet upon the land. I may not yet leave
Britain. Not until I have kept the counsel of Hilda and
my promise to my father at his tomb."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do as thou hast said," replied Olaf, "lest evil fortune
come to thee. But go thou now and look at the trireme.
Is she not thine, to do with as thou wilt?"</p>

<p>"I will go," said Ulric, and with him went only Knud
the Bear, by his ordering.</p>

<p>First went they upon <i>The Sword</i>, for she was nearer,
and she was now lashed side by side with the trireme.
High above the low bulwarks of the ship from the Northland
arose the strong sides of the war vessel of Cæsar,
and her greater force in fight or in rough seas was evident.
Ulric looked and he thought of the sayings of
Olaf, the son of Hakon, for a shrewd suggestion
sprouteth in the mind of a wise man like a seed sown in
a garden.</p>

<p>"Truly we were overcrowded," said Ulric, standing
upon the fore deck of <i>The Sword</i>. "We are thrice too
many souls for so small a ship as this. There was too
little room for provisions or for sleeping. There is none
at all for the storage of spoils. The men will not brook
the burning of the shares which may fall to them. They
like not my hard ruling even thus far."</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Knud, "what sayest thou? Let us not
burn good plunder. What good to win it if we carry it
not home with us? I would now go on board the trireme."</p>

<p>"Come," said Ulric, and they climbed up over her high
bulwark, noting how thick it was and well joined together.
Thus they passed from stem to stern and in and
out of cabins, examining all things&mdash;the oars, the ropes,
and the sails.</p>

<p>"She is provided for a long voyage," said the jarl.
"Sawest thou ever such armor and such store of weapons?
We may need them in the southern seas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will we," replied Knud; "but I am an old seaman
and I was thinking of yonder sails. There are twain.
They are of strongly woven stuff&mdash;not skins, like our sail.
They will save much rowing. There are good anchors
also. Thou sayest well, we are too many in <i>The Sword</i>."</p>

<p>Yet she seemed very beautiful as she lay at the side of
the trireme, and the jarl remembered how his heart had
gone out to her while she was building. She had borne
him well, also, and she had proved herself. What might
he do with the vessel that he loved? He went on board
of her again and he stood by the hammer of Thor on the
fore deck.</p>

<p>"What thinkest thou?" asked Knud. "What if I&mdash;for
I am a smith&mdash;put now the anvil and the hammer on the
fore deck of the trireme? Will she not then be <i>The
Sword</i>? Will not Thor and Odin go with her?"</p>

<p>"Do even as thou hast said!" loudly exclaimed Ulric.
"So the gods go with us what matter for a wooden keel?"</p>

<p>But his heart smote him sorely.</p>

<p>"I would," he thought, "that I might have speech with
Hilda. I will go on shore and question Olaf. He is old."</p>

<p>Old was he and crafty, for already he had been saying
many things to the vikings. He had told them of keels
overwhelmed in the storms of the southern seas, or
crushed by the rams of Roman warships. He had spoken
of hungers and thirsts because of lack of room for provisions,
and of fights lost because there were no more arrows
to shoot or spears to throw. The young men heard
him eagerly, and even the old warriors listened with care.
They also called to mind such things and told of them,
and all who chose to look could see the difference in size
between the two vessels that floated in the cove.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Great Sacrifice of the Druids.</small></span></h2>


<p>In the deep forest stood Olaf, the son of Hakon, and
before him stood a tall, venerable man clad in a robe of
white which came down to his feet, whereon were sandals.
On his head was naught save abundant gray hair
and a circlet of beaten gold. On his arms were heavy
rings of gold, deeply graven, and in his hand was a long
white wand, gold tipped.</p>

<p>"Thou and thy Saxon friends have done well," he said
in the Latin tongue. "But I like not this message from
their jarl."</p>

<p>"He doth but ask of thee, O high priest," replied Olaf,
"that he, who is not as another man, but is of the sons of
the gods of the North, may reverence thy gods for the aid
they have given him by sea and land, and that he may be
present at the great sacrifice, as becometh him. If he may
so do, he will give thee a thing the like of which thou
hast never seen hitherto, and he will smite for thee the
Romans."</p>

<p>"Cometh he then from Odin?" asked the Druid.</p>

<p>"From Odin," said Olaf; "and of higher rank than he
is none among the Saxons."</p>

<p>"He is not a king," said the Druid, "but I know of jarls
and of their pedigrees. The Romans at thy village are
this day smitten by the Britons and we need not his
sword. Well is it, however, for him to give a gift. Let
him see to it that his offering be right precious. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
day's journey to the sacred place. He may not come
down to the valley of the gods, but he may stand upon
the hill, among the oaks, and afterward I will receive his
token."</p>

<p>"So be it, O high priest," said Olaf, and he turned
away, as did also the Druid.</p>

<p>"Cunning is he," muttered Olaf, as he walked. "But
in us also is there prudence and the jarl will be guided
in the matter. I think he will not fall into this trap of the
Britons. They plotted against us before the Romans
came, and gladly would they see Saxon blood upon the
stones of sacrifice."</p>

<p>So said he to the jarl at the camp late in the day, and
Ulric listened, pondering.</p>

<p>"Olaf," he said, after a silence, "Wulf the Skater hath
returned from looking at thy place. No other trireme
hath arrived, but even while he was watching did the
Britons swarm over the palisades. The Romans were
too few to guard their lines, and it was in vain for them
to resist a multitude. Thy vengeance is complete."</p>

<p>"The gods have done this," said Olaf. "But what wilt
thou do in this other matter?"</p>

<p>"I will leave a strong guard with the ship," said the
jarl, "but with the greater number I will go to look upon
the sacrifices. Thou wilt guide by a road they know not,
and we will defeat their cunning."</p>

<p>"They would not strike thee, I think," said Olaf, "until
after the sacrifices. This is their reverence to their gods."</p>

<p>"I would I knew," said Ulric, "the name of one of their
gods. I will not sacrifice to one to whom I may not
speak. He is a breath."</p>

<p>"Thou mayest not enter the sacred valley," said Olaf;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
"but I have somewhat more to tell thee. Now do I know
what is the name of thy captured trireme."</p>

<p>"The hammer of Thor is on her deck at this hour," said
the jarl. "She is no longer Roman. But whose is that
gilded shape under her beak? It seemeth a woman wearing
a helmet."</p>

<p>"The Druid told me," said Olaf. "She is Minerva.
She is to the Romans as are the Nornir. She is both wise
and crafty, being a saga woman, and there are runes concerning
her."</p>

<p>"She is, then, not of the sea," said the jarl. "I think
she will not contend with Thor. It were ill fortune to
disturb her, seeing she hath delivered to us the ship; but
we must give to it the name of <i>The Sword</i> or Odin were
justly angry, for we gave our keel to him.</p>

<p>"Thou hast decided well," said Olaf; "but if so, then
there must remain one keel only, not twain. It was commanded
thee to burn one ship in Britain, and thou mayest
not break thy word to the dead and to the gods."</p>

<p>"That will I not," said Ulric; "but now we must speedily
prepare this expedition."</p>

<p>Wise had been the work of the tongue of Olaf, for now
came the vikings to Ulric to speak concerning <i>The Sword</i>
and the trireme, so that this which was to be done appeared
not as by his ordering, but as the counsel of all.</p>

<p>"Thou doest well," they told him, "to yield to us in this
matter. We will have a larger ship. We will have room
for our plunder. We care not overmuch for thy small
keel, and we will burn her at the seaside. Thou art our
jarl in battle, but thou mayest not rule in all things."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they agreed with him all the more readily
concerning the sacrifices, and those who were to go and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
those who were to stay by the ships were chosen by lot
lest any should accuse the jarl of unfairness; for it was
hoped that here was to be fighting. Not yet had there
been any division of the spoils because all agreed to wait
until a more convenient season, or even until the end of
the voyage.</p>

<p>"They whom the valkyrias do not name," said one,
"may apportion whatever may then be found in the ship.
There will be fewer weapons, perchance, and fewer men."</p>

<p>In the dawn of the next day did the jarl lead out his
men, and in the dusk did the march end. High and
round-topped was the hill in the forest to which Olaf
guided them, and below was a narrow valley, bare of
trees. There was yet light to see that in the middle of
the valley were many great stones. Some of these stood
upright in a wide circle, like the burial stones of the
North peoples, but much larger. Other stones, long and
weighty, lay flat, upheld a little from the ground by
bowlders under them at either end.</p>

<p>"They are stones of sacrifice," said Olaf. "On them
do they slay both cattle and men. But seest thou the
cages?"</p>

<p>"Penthouses of wood I see," said Ulric. "Very large,
but of one story and roofed flatly. On the roofs and
against the sides are heaps of wood. What are these?"</p>

<p>"Wait till thou seest," said Olaf. "Their shape on the
ground is as the body and the arms and the legs of a man,
and there is a meaning in it known to the Druids. They
make this wooden man of sacrifice, and they fill him full
of men and women and children that he may feast. They
have made many war captives and they have condemned
many for evil-doing or for speaking against the Druids."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great fires are lighting around the valley and near
the stones," remarked Tostig the Red. "I have seen many
men slain upon stones. It is the right place to slay them,
where the gods can see all. We shall have a rare treat.
But there are hundreds of Britons. They wear little
clothing."</p>

<p>"They paint themselves blue, instead," said Olaf.
"But it keepeth not out either the cold or a spear point."</p>

<p>More and more numerous grew the throngs in the valley,
coming out from under the trees beyond. Not among
them, but walking through them in a procession, came
scores at a time of the white-robed Druids, bearing no
arms, but leading with them human beings of both sexes,
arm-fettered, defenseless, making no resistance. There
was a loud sound of harping and chanting as the processions
drew near the flat stones.</p>

<p>Behind each of these stood a Druid with a large knife,
and before him, stone by stone, was laid a victim. Then
fell the knives in quick succession, with a twanging of
harps and a shout, but the Northmen saw no great difference
between this offering and such as they had witnessed
elsewhere. As the firelight brightened, however,
they could discern that the walls of the wooden man in
the middle were open, with wide crevices, through which
might be seen the naked forms of those who were shut
in. They were even crowded, and they uttered loud cries
as they saw torches placed against the heaps of wood surrounding
the pen.</p>

<p>"Dry wood," said Knud the Bear. "See how it kindleth!
A hot fire! These are to be burned for their god?
He is a bad one. I like it not. The Romans do well to
kill these Druids. I would slay them myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>So said all the vikings, and had there been more of
them, they might have vented their anger at this thing.
It was not good, even for a god, but the throngs of
Britons were well armed, after their fashion, and Ulric's
men were but few in comparison.</p>

<p>"We would not mind four or five to one," he said, "but
we could not slay such a multitude. The fires burn terribly!
It is not at all like kindly slaying with a sword."</p>

<p>"A cut on a man's neck is nothing," said Tostig. "He
falleth and that is an end. I hope to fall by a sword some
day."</p>

<p>The shrieks and cries of agony were dreadful, rising
above the twanging of the harps and the chanting of the
Druids. There was no help for any of these who were
doomed. Among them, said some of the vikings, must be
all the Roman prisoners if any had been taken. The burning
roofs fell in and so did the red blazings of the side
walls. Nor did the swarms of the Britons cease to yell
with the pleasure of cruelty while they gazed upon the
frantic struggles of these victims.</p>

<p>"We have seen enough," said Olaf, at last. "O jarl,
we have far to go. I hope we may again strike the
Romans shortly, but I care not much if good Saxon
spears find many marks among the Druids. It would require
a host of Saxons to hold this island, killing them
all, but I am one who will go back to the North and come
again, bringing stout slayers with me."</p>

<p>"Some of the white-robed ones come in this direction
even now," responded the jarl. "Behind them are spearmen.
They must not find us upon this hill, but the woods
are overdark to march in."</p>

<p>"After we are well covered," said Olaf, "we may kindle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
torches, but the way by which I lead you is plain and
wide, for the war chariots of the British kings have made
it in the old days. The Romans now prevent them from
having any chariots within their dominions, but there are
free tribes beyond their borders. Come!"</p>

<p>"On!" said the jarl. "This hill was to have been their
trap. They seek to march around that they may cut off
our going. On!"</p>

<p>Swiftly marched the Saxons for a while, but the darkness
of the forest was dense, and now they halted to
kindle torches.</p>

<p>"The Druids and their men carried many and bright
ones," said Ulric, "so that we saw them enter the woods,
but we are too far now for them to discern our own."</p>

<p>After this there were pauses for resting, but the vikings
marched on until the dawn. Then went they forward
again, fasting, but at the noon they were greeted by the
shouts of the men who held the palisades at the spring.</p>

<p>"O Tostig the Red," responded the jarl, "hath all been
well with thee and with the camp?"</p>

<p>"Hael, O jarl!" said Tostig. "All is well. We have
seen Britons at a distance among the trees, but none came
near for speech. I think they are not overfriendly."</p>

<p>"That are they not, but treacherous," said Ulric. "But
now let there be roasting and eating and sleeping, and
then we shall have new matters upon our hands. We
have seen things that are worth telling around a fire in the
winter evenings. I like not these gods of the Britons.
They are evil-minded."</p>

<p>Many were busy at the fires with venison and with
fishes which had been caught, but they who had remained
at the camp were cooks for the weary men who could tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of this sacrifice of the Druids. As for the jarl, he ate and
drank and then he went on board <i>The Sword</i> and lay
down to sleep upon the after deck, saying little to any
man, and Tostig the Red came and sat down by him.</p>

<p>Orders had been given, moreover, and before the setting
of the sun both keels were anchored some fathoms
out from low-water mark, and only the small boats were
at the beach. It was best, the jarl had said, to trust deep
water rather than a stockade after the darkness should
come. All the fires in the camp were heaped to burn long,
and so were other large fires upon the strand. Then came
all the vikings on board the ship, and there could be no
present peril. It was a night of peace, but the watchers
saw both dark forms and white ones by the light of the
fires, and knew that the Britons had come.</p>

<p>"The white ones are the Druids," said Wulf the Skater
to his companions. "I am not afraid of their gods which
have men roasted. I hope the jarl will find us a chance
to spear priests before we sail away from this island."</p>

<p>The rest agreed with him, asking him many questions
concerning the sacrifices.</p>

<p>"But for the prudence of the jarl," he also told them,
"all we who went would have been taken at a disadvantage
in the darkness of the forest. There would have
been no fair fighting."</p>

<p>"He is a good battle jarl," they said, but it might be
seen that among them were some who were not well
pleased with his ways.</p>

<p>There, safe from all assailing, floated the two keels until
the dawn. Then went some of the men ashore in the small
boats, and the fires were replenished for cooking, but none
were permitted to wander into the woods. On board the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
trireme there was much search going on and great was
the delight of all over the plunder discovered. Rich indeed
was the store of arms, as if it had been intended to
refit a cohort or to arm new recruits.</p>

<p>"It is good, too," they said, "to be able to walk around.
There was hardly elbow-room on our own keel. But we
knew that we must lose some and that there would be less
crowding when we came home."</p>

<p>"We can give a man to every oar of the trireme," said
Ulric, "and yet leave threescore to the spears."</p>

<p>But he looked over the bulwark and down into the
good ship <i>The Sword</i>, and his heart smote him sadly, for
the very wood she was made of came from his own trees,
and she seemed to look him in the face kindly.</p>

<p>Hours went by before there were any newcomers upon
the shore, but Olaf said that there must be patience.</p>

<p>"Watch also," he warned Ulric, "and let not any
Briton come on board. We will meet them in the small
boats at the strand."</p>

<p>So it came to be, for at the noon the woods became
alive with men. Foremost came the chief Druid, followed
by some of lesser rank and by harpers. With them
were chiefs of clans of the Britons, each one calling himself
a king, but being really less than a Norse jarl in
power, for he was as a slave to all Druids.</p>

<p>"These," told Olaf, "make the laws and enforce them.
They alone know the sagas of the Britons and what is
to be given to the gods. They sometimes burn a king if
he worketh not their will, and they have magic arts which
make the people fear them. I would slay all such if I
were a king."</p>

<p>He and Ulric were in the same boat pulling to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
strand; and the chief Druid was wise, for he came to
meet them attended only by two other Druids and by
seven of his harpers. Behind them under the trees clustered
the British warriors. They formed no ranks, but
they wore a fierce, warlike appearance. Among them
were some in armor that was half Roman, as if taken in
battle. More had Roman swords, but their own British
blades were both short and light. All were armed with
javelins, but their shields were of all sorts, only that most
of them were made of wicker and hide.</p>

<p>"They are brave enough," said Olaf, "but the Romans
seek to prevent them from getting weapons. A Briton
might become as good a soldier as a legionary, with arms
and with training. Cæsar is always cunning in government."</p>

<p>"Hael, O Druid!" shouted Ulric. "I am well pleased
to see thee."</p>

<p>"O thou, the jarl of the vikings," sternly responded the
chief Druid. "Too many came with thee. My permission
was but to thee and to Olaf. Neither didst thou do
reverence to my gods."</p>

<p>"O priest," said the jarl, "I came and I returned as I
would. I like not thy gods. What is thy errand with
me this day?"</p>

<p>The face of Ulric had flushed hotly upon hearing the
haughty speech of the Druid, for he was not one to be
lightly chidden by any man.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said the Druid yet more sternly, "I have this
also against thee, that thou didst promise me a treasure
the like of which I never saw before, and thou didst not
deliver it. Where is thy great gift?"</p>

<p>"O Knud the Bear," shouted Ulric, "row now to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
shore and bring to this priest the token of the son of
Odin."</p>

<p>The second of the small boats came to the shore and
Knud and eight other of the tallest vikings, ax in hand,
bore out and spread upon the earth the tremendous hide
of the white bear, the king of bears. From the skull, also,
they had reft its whole cover, putting in eyes of bright
leather. The hide seemed to be longer and broader than
in life, as if it lay two fathoms from tail to nose.</p>

<p>"O jarl of the Saxons," exclaimed the Druid, "what is
this? I have heard of these creatures, but never have I
seen one."</p>

<p>"Then have I kept my promise," said Ulric. "Thou
mayest hang it in thy house or in the house of thy gods,
as thou wilt, but never was the like of it in Britain. He
was a son of the ice king. He came from the long darkness,
and I slew him with my own hand."</p>

<p>Around the jarl stood now a score of vikings; terrible
men for a foe to look upon, for they were throwers of
sudden spears. Still stood the chief Druid and his fellows
and the harpers, gazing at the great skin, and the
Britons in the edge of the wood shouted loudly.</p>

<p>"I agree with thee as to this," said the high priest, reluctantly.
"I accept thy token, for in it is a meaning that
thou knowest not. There is an old prophecy concerning
the Northern Bear and Britain. Thou hast done well.
My quarrel is now with Olaf, who standeth by thee."</p>

<p>"But for him thou wouldst have slain me and mine in
thy forest trap on the hill, at the sacrifices," answered the
jarl, angrily. "Thy quarrel is also with me!"</p>

<p>Then came the rush of the Britons from the woods,
hurling javelins as they came, but the vikings were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>stantly
in their boats, and the high priest and all who
were with him lay upon the sand, so suddenly were they
smitten. From the ships came showers of spears, arrows,
stones, and the men in the small boats seemed to be
unharmed, for their shields were up.</p>

<p>"Thou sittest very still," said Ulric to Olaf. "What
sayest thou? Mine eyes were upon these blue ones."</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Knud the Bear, "we lifted him in,
thinking there might still be life in him, but there is none.
The spear of the high priest was strongly driven."</p>

<p>"Hael to thee, O hero!" shouted the jarl. "Olaf, the
son of Hakon, hath gone to Valhalla! He hath died in
his armor! Row to the ships. We will go hence and the
body of Olaf we will bury in the sea. There shall be no
lamenting for the son of Hakon."</p>

<p>Only this harm had befallen the Saxons from the
treachery of the Druids, while the slain lying upon the
beach were many. Loudly now arose the wailing of the
Britons, for they had a strange death cry of their own,
long and vibrating, that went far out across the sea.</p>

<p>"Their gods will be against us," said Wulf the Skater.
"We may not now linger long in Britain."</p>

<p>"Very soon," said the jarl, "we will sail for the Middle
Sea, but not with two keels. We are too few."</p>

<p><i>The Sword</i> and the trireme, nevertheless, were now
going out to sea with all oars, as if to show how many
men were needed for this. The jarl was at the helm of
the trireme and his face was clouded.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said, "have I smitten the Romans upon
the land of Britain. That must I do, and I know not
how or where. The days go by and it will be winter
before we reach the Middle Sea. The voyage is long."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Passing of Lars the Old.</small></span></h2>


<p>Sudden is the change from winter to summer in the
Northland. The buds of the trees get ready under the
frost and open to the sunshine as soon as a few days of
warmth have told them that they may safely burst forth.
No full leaves were as yet, but the grass was greening
and the fisher boats were busy in the fiords.</p>

<p>In the hall of the house of Brander there were fewer to
gather now, in the lengthening evenings, around the central
fire, but Oswald's harp was always there. Hilda,
from her chair, would often ask him to strike up, but there
was a lack of spirit in his minstrelsy, and even when she
spoke to him her voice was weaker and softer than of old.
The wrinkles upon her face were deepening, and they who
looked long at her said to one another that a light which
did not come from the fire played now and then across her
forehead and around her mouth. At other times she was
shut up much in her own room, and it was said that she
pored long and thoughtfully over polished sheepskins and
fragments of gray stone whereon were graven runes that
none else might read. Some of these, they said, had been
brought by Odin's men when they journeyed from the
East into the Northland. Who knew, therefore, but
what the runes had been written in the city of Asgard by
the hands of the Asas? It was not well to question over-closely
about such things. They said naught to her of
the matters which were her own, and only once did a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
maiden yield to her own curiosity and follow the old saga
woman when at night she walked out along the path
which led to the stones of the mighty dead. Afterward
she told her mother, and then all the village knew, that
Hilda did but sit down by the tomb of Brander, weeping
loudly and talking with him concerning his absent son.</p>

<p>"It is no wonder," said the villagers, "for she loved
Ulric the Jarl. It is good for all our men that Hilda
should speak to the gods concerning their welfare. She
knoweth them better than we do, and she is to go to them
soon. She getteth ready daily."</p>

<p>So fared it in the Northland, but many ships were putting
to sea, and there was even jealousy here and there
that Ulric and <i>The Sword</i> should have gotten away so
much in advance of all others. But the ships of the vikings
would now be so many as to bode ill for the fleets of
Rome and for the merchantmen of the Middle Sea unless
Cæsar should send force enough to prevent their coming.</p>

<p>"Olaf told me," said Ulric, talking to Tostig of such
matters, "that the Romans fear the coming of the Saxons.
Therefore against our villages as well as against the rebellious
Druids came these triremes at this time. Cæsar's
power in Britain groweth. Around his fortified camps
are cities springing up, and he fortifieth also ancient towns.
We must come with many keels and a great host when we
take this island away from Cæsar."</p>

<p>"But I think we will destroy the Britons," said Tostig
the Red, "for we have seen that we may not trust them.
I like a place where there is so much good hunting."</p>

<p>Ulric had been scanning the shore line, for he was steering,
and now he said:</p>

<p>"We will anchor for the night within yonder rocky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>point. There is a ledge there for which I have been
seeking."</p>

<p>All day had the two ships been coasting slowly, and the
men had wondered much what it might be that was in the
mind of their jarl, for he was moody. He had also asked
many questions of the older vikings. The two ships
came to anchor not many fathoms out from the rocky
point, but all men were forbidden venturing to the
shore.</p>

<p>"It is not well," said Ulric to some who would have
landed in the small boats. "If ye but look closely, ye will
discern the glimmer of fires in the deep forest. Our
movement this day hath been followed, and now a small
party might meet too many of their spearmen. They are
good fighters."</p>

<p>There was much grumbling among the younger men,
for they despised this prudence of his which ever held
them in and thwarted their hot wills, but they had no
choice but to obey him concerning the boats.</p>

<p>More and more plainly through the night darkness
might the watchers on the decks discern the fires that were
kindled in the woods. The jarl gazed at them long,
thinking many things concerning the Druids and the other
Saxon villages of the shore of Britain. He slept after a
while to the slow rocking of the ship, and when morn
came Wulf the Skater stood by him.</p>

<p>"O jarl," he said, "the Britons build fires along the
beach. They swim out to us. I have speared four of
their swimmers. What do we next?"</p>

<p>Ulric arose and gave orders. Immediately a transfer
began from <i>The Sword</i> to the trireme of all arms and
provisions, and the men worked rapidly. Only that Wulf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
worked not, and that an old viking came and stood by
him at the bulwark.</p>

<p>"I like it not," said Wulf, "but Ulric is jarl. What
sayest thou, Lars the Old, the shipmaker?"</p>

<p>"Thou art a seaman," said Lars. "I am of thy mind.
I toiled much in the shaping and the making of <i>The
Sword</i>. My heart is heavy."</p>

<p>"So is mine!" exclaimed Wulf. "First of all men,
after the jarl, did I take her helm. She is Odin's keel.
There is bad fortune in leaving her."</p>

<p>"That do I fear," said Lars, "but I leave her not. I
was sore smitten in the ribs in the fight with the Druids
on the beach. I bleed well now. I shall not sail in this
trireme."</p>

<p>"Good is thy fate," said Wulf. "Didst thou tell the
jarl thou wert wounded?"</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Lars. "None know but a few of our
old vikings. I thought not much of it at first, for I have
oft been wounded. But now they will soon burn <i>The
Sword</i>. I command thee that thou lay me upon the fore
deck, where was once the hammer of Thor. That is my
death place."</p>

<p>"That will I do," said Wulf. "So will say the jarl."</p>

<p>"So do I now say!" came to them in his own voice, for
he also was leaning over the rail and he had heard. "O
Lars, I knew not of thy hurt, thinking only of Olaf, the
son of Hakon. Him have we buried in the sea this day,
and thou shalt have thy will. <i>The Sword</i> is nearly
emptied. We burn her on yonder rocks at the point as
the tide falleth. We will lay thee upon her fore deck with
thy arms and armor."</p>

<p>"Do thou thy duty by me," said Lars, "that it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
well with thee. But leave not <i>The Sword</i> until every
timber shall be burned, lest some part of her shall fall into
an enemy's hand."</p>

<p>"She is ready!" exclaimed Ulric. "We will lift the
anchors and move both ships. There will be many to see
the burning."</p>

<p>Trumpetings and harpings and angry shouts were
answering from a throng of Britons gathering along the
shore. Not any of them could guess as yet what would
be the next move of the Saxons, but great was their wrath
that they were able to do no harm.</p>

<p>"They would we might find reason for landing," said
Ulric to Wulf, "but I care not to strike them at this place.
We would gain nothing."</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Wulf, "Lars, the shipmaker, lieth down.
The valkyrias are with him."</p>

<p>"He dieth not a cow's death," said Ulric, "but as a true
warrior of the North. It is as he would will, but he still
is breathing."</p>

<p>"Yea, but heavily," said Wulf. "I would I were as he
is, that I might not leave <i>The Sword</i>."</p>

<p>"O Wulf," said the jarl, "thou hast many a feast of
swords before thee. Cheer thee up."</p>

<p>"Jarl Ulric," said Wulf, "do I not know thee? Thou
too lovest thy first keel. But I think thou doest wisely.
The men have demanded this, and they may not be gainsaid.
But I would there had been men enough for both
ships, and then I would not have left mine own."</p>

<p>On moved the two keels toward the ledge of rocks, and
the tide was falling. They would be bare before long.</p>

<p>"Row, now!" shouted the jarl. "Send <i>The Sword</i> far
up upon the ledge. She must be lifted by the rocks till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
she is out of the water. There come the Britons toward
the point. Be ready to strike them! The Druids have
gathered an army!"</p>

<p>No sail was raised upon either of the ships, but the
rowers of the trireme paused while those of <i>The Sword</i>
pulled strongly. She was light now, having no stowage
or ballast, and quickly her prow was thrust high up the
ledge between two masses of dark gray stone. Then the
trireme was grappled at her stern and many Saxons
sprang out upon the ledge. There were several fathoms
of water between this and the shore.</p>

<p>"Fast falleth the tide," said Ulric. "Lift ye now Lars
the Old, the shipmaker, and bear him to the fore deck of
<i>The Sword</i>. Lay by him his arms and his armor, breaking
the sword and the spear and cleaving the shield and
mail that no other may ever bear them."</p>

<p>The vikings carried the old warrior quickly, and he
uttered no sound. They laid him upon the fore deck and
did as Ulric commanded, but the hilt of the broken sword,
having yet half the length of its bright blade, they put into
his right hand. In the middle of the ship much wood was
placed, heaping it, and in this heap a blazing torch was
thrust. Then all the vikings left <i>The Sword</i>, and the
greater part of her was already out of water.</p>

<p>"They come in swarms!" exclaimed Tostig the Red,
gazing at the Britons who rushed along the shore toward
the point. "Hael! the fire burneth well! They must not
prevent it!"</p>

<p>Up leaped the long-armed flames, catching the fagots
of pine splinters.</p>

<p>"Burn thou, O <i>Sword</i>!" shouted the jarl. "I give thee
to Odin in the fire! Thou art mine own, O good ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
from the Northland. I would I might have sailed in thee
to the Middle Sea and to the city of the gods!"</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Wulf the Skater, "even so would I have
sailed. I think we shall never see that city. The gods
are far away, and I know not if they have any city. I am
dark this day, and over me is a cloud."</p>

<p>The jarl spoke not again, but he looked earnestly at
<i>The Sword</i> and at that which was threatening along the
shore. Still as a stone lay Lars the Old, and some men
thought him dead. There were Druids now at the point,
and with them were harpers and trumpeters, and the
white-robed ones were chanting to their gods.</p>

<p>The chanting ceased and a Druid raised his sacred
wand, shouting fiercely. At that word hundreds of
armed Britons began to rush into the sea.</p>

<p>"They are too many," said Knud the Bear. "They do
but drown each other. These Druids are not good captains.
Therefore are they beaten by the Romans in spite
of their gods and their sacrifices."</p>

<p>The fire ran everywhere along the bulwarks of <i>The
Sword</i> and began to climb over the decks. It climbed the
high mast and the wind blew it out like a banner.</p>

<p>"Odin!" shouted Ulric. "The Britons are on the
rocks! Smite now!"</p>

<p>Fast flew the arrows and the spears, and almost useless
were the wicker shields of the Britons. Many of them
had none, and their blue bodies were plain marks for shaft
and stone. They fell in heaps upon the ledge, but a score
of them broke through the flames to the very fore deck of
<i>The Sword</i>, and here too the fire was blazing hotly.
Here before them lay Lars the Old, stretched out as on his
funeral pyre. These were of the best armored of the Brit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>ons,
and one could understand that they had thought to
take <i>The Sword</i> and push her off, that by her means they
might reach the trireme.</p>

<p>No good captain would so have planned, for such a
thing might not be done; but these men were brave, for
they stood well and some of them hurled their darts vigorously
at the vikings, while others strove vainly to shove
<i>The Sword</i> from the rocks into the sea.</p>

<p>This thing that came not any man had expected.
Just as the strong fire in the cabin began to burst up redly
through the fore deck, and a fiercer flame mounted the
after deck, and all the bulwarks were ablaze, up to his feet
sprang Lars the Old, his gray hair streaming in the wind.
One blow he struck with his broken sword, burying it in
the body of a British chief, and then he began to ply his
long-handled ax with the strength of one who is dying.
Upon him turned the spears and the swords of the Britons
and he was stricken quickly. He did not shout, but he
cleft one more while falling.</p>

<p>"The hero dieth!" said the jarl, hurling his spear, and
it flew well, but there were not many now upon the fore deck.</p>

<p>More were swimming from the shore to the ledge, but
the fire was completing its work, and the plan of the
Druids was broken altogether. When once more the
wind put aside the black curtain of the smoke it was seen
that the entire prow had fallen in and that to the very
helm the flames were fighting joyously.</p>

<p>"We will stay by until she is burned to her keel," said
Ulric; "but now pull out a little further."</p>

<p>So did they, and the Britons came no more to the ledge,
for the prize they had hoped for was a heap of ashes upon
the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"A good ship was she," muttered Knud the Bear.
"She fought well against the ice floes and the storms.
May all the gods go with us in this trireme. I would I
knew her by some name."</p>

<p>"O Knud," loudly responded Ulric, "I will answer thee.
This keel that was Roman hath become Saxon, and her
name is now <i>The Sword</i>. Else we had not burned the
other. The trireme shall be to us as if we had builded
her on the shore of the Northland. She will sail with the
hammer of Thor and the flag of Odin and not with a
Roman god."</p>

<p>"I am better satisfied," exclaimed Wulf the Skater.
"But many good rowers must take the oars of this trireme
in battle. She is heavy."</p>

<p>"I think," said Tostig the Red, "that we are stronger
than are the hired rowers or the slave rowers of the
Romans. Her beak will break the ribs of another keel
and she will do well in storms."</p>

<p>The jarl's eyes were still upon the burning timbers
which remained upon the ledge.</p>

<p>"I will take a boat," he said, "and men with me. We
must gather all fragments for utter destruction."</p>

<p>Upon that duty he went, and it was made complete before
the small boat returned to the trireme. All the while
many Britons watched them from the shore, but came
not against them.</p>

<p>"Too many of them have been slain," said the vikings.
"They like not our heavy spears."</p>

<p>Before climbing into the trireme the jarl made them
row to her beak, that he might examine well its form and
its power for striking a blow, and that he might also look
more closely at the figurehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is much waterworn," he said. "She is the wise
woman among the gods of the Romans. She will care
not much that the hammer of Thor is on the fore deck."</p>

<p>The small boat was hoisted to its place and the vikings
began to speak more freely of the trireme by her new
name of <i>The Sword</i>.</p>

<p>"Up with the sails," commanded Ulric. "The wind
is fair. We will go southward this night, and we will
seek the Saxon village that was described to me by Olaf,
the son of Hakon. But we will not go too fast or too far,
lest we may pass it in the dark."</p>

<p>"There may be our kinsmen there that need our aid,"
said Knud the Bear. "Seax in hand it would be a pleasure
to meet Romans."</p>

<p>Now did they begin to discover how much more room
there was to walk in from place to place around the ship,
but the younger men praised their own prudence for this
more than that of Ulric the Jarl. Moreover, to please all,
he caused to be brought forth many weapons and much
armor. These the men handled curiously, trying on the
helmets and the mail and testing the weight of the shields.
Garments, also, were given as the men would, and they
laughed merrily at each other for the strangeness of their
changed appearance.</p>

<p>Well out from the land steered the jarl, not knowing
the coast, and there was careful watching for breakers
which might tell of shoals or rocks. He was learning,
also, the sailing of this keel and her manner of answering
the rudder.</p>

<p>"She is swift," he thought, "and she rideth well the
waves. We build not yet such vessels in the Northland,
though we have plenty of good timber. She will carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
us safely into the Middle Sea, but there is room in her for
more men. She requireth too many for her oars. I will
sail rather than row, lest I breed too much discontent."</p>

<p>Far behind him now went out the last burning of the
timbers of the good keel he had builded in the Northland,
but upon the mast of this which carried him floated still
the White Horse flag of the Saxons which had been given
to <i>The Sword</i> by Hilda of the hundred years.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>Svein the Cunning Jarl.</small></span></h2>


<p>Sailing on in the darkness, over an unknown sea, the
trireme, which was now the viking ship <i>The Sword</i>,
moved toward the dawn. None on board of her knew the
low-lying coast which was in sight when the sun looked
over the horizon.</p>

<p>"We are nearer than I deemed," said Ulric; but he was
at the prow now, and an old Danish seaman was at the
helm.</p>

<p>"There are rocks hereaway at the right," replied Tostig
the Red, "but I can see houses and lines of palisades.
The Britons build not such houses. They are like our
own."</p>

<p>"There are fields, also, and cattle," said Knud the Bear.
"There are men on the beach. Let us sail in. Hark!
War horns! We are waited for."</p>

<p>"It is a good harbor," said Ulric. "There are four
keels on the strand, but they are small. And there are
boats. These are not Romans."</p>

<p>"They will deem that we are," said Tostig. "Thy
horn, O jarl."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Ulric. "We will go nearer. All
rowers to the oars! Let down the sail!"</p>

<p>Then came a surprise to those who were on <i>The Sword</i>,
so very numerous were the warriors who came down to
the shore outside of the lines of the palisades on the harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
side of the village. This, too, was seen to be larger as
they drew nearer, and some of the houses were as great
as was the home house of Brander the Brave.</p>

<p>"It is as Olaf told me," thought Ulric. "The Romans
do well to fear the Saxons of this coast. We will be
friends with these men."</p>

<p>The rowers had brought the ship well in and Ulric
stood by the hammer of Thor. Three times be blew his
horn, standing bareheaded, nor was there any Roman
helmet worn by those who were with him. Moreover, the
banner on the mast was the White Horse of the Saxons.</p>

<p>Horns answered him, and then there were shouts of
greeting, while some of the shore men pushed out in a
small boat.</p>

<p>"Come near!" said Ulric to these. "I am Ulric the
Jarl, the son of Brander the Brave. We come in peace.
Who are ye?"</p>

<p>Upon his feet arose a short, squarely made man in the
boat. He wore fine armor and there was a golden crest
upon his steel headpiece.</p>

<p>"I am Svein Jarl," he responded. "We are Saxons all,
and this town on the shore is Rika. Where didst thou
win thy keel? I tell thee we are at peace with the
Romans, as we are with thee."</p>

<p>"So be it," said Ulric; but then he told of Olaf and of
the Druids and of the triremes and of the Roman camp.</p>

<p>"Strong tryst between me and thee," said Svein.
"Thou hast done well. Olaf would never make peace because
they slew his father, as did they thine. They would
crucify thee because of thy trireme. But word came to
me that the Roman consul Licinius is in Britain, and I
have sent him bodes, making agreement. We are at war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
only with the rebellious Britons, not with his own. We
are too few to contend with Rome. Land thou and thine
if thou wilt, but see that thou sailest away quickly."</p>

<p>"I understand thee," said Ulric. "I am but one trireme
against more than one if the consul sendeth them.
But we will not land here. I will go to thy house in
greeting, but no more."</p>

<p>"Come," said Svein. "I like thy flag, and I was thy
father's sure comrade. The son of Brander is welcome
to the house of Svein Jarl."</p>

<p>Small boats from the ship were ready, and in one went
Ulric to the shore, taking with him many men in the other
boats, for he thought: "I know not Svein well, and Olaf
spoke ill of him. He is a friend of the Romans."</p>

<p>So said the vikings who remained on the ship, and
they kept good watch, saying to one another:</p>

<p>"We like it not that our jarl should thus venture himself.
How know we what is behind yonder palisades?"</p>

<p>Hearty and kindly were the words spoken to Ulric and
his Saxons by the warriors who met them at the beach.
Neither did Svein seem to lack in any wise, but walked on
toward the palisades, bidding the newcomers to follow.
At the side of Ulric the Jarl now walked a tall man and
large, in full armor, but wearing over his shoulder a bearskin.</p>

<p>"I am Sigurd, the son of Thorolf," he said. "I am a
Northman, like thyself. The greater part of Svein's men
are Danes, as he is. I am not with him, save that my
keel was wrecked and I owe him for hospitality. But I
am free, having fought for him against the Britons."</p>

<p>"Sail thou with me," said Ulric. "There is room in
<i>The Sword</i>. Share thou fight and prizes by land and
sea. Thou art welcome."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will put my hands in thine and be thy man," said
Sigurd. "Mark thou this, then. When we pass the gate
of the palisades many will come and range themselves
with thee and me, for they are as I am and would depart
from this place. Thou hast thine ax. Be thou ready to
smite with it, as will I and mine."</p>

<p>Then those who looked upon the face of Ulric saw that
it became white and that his eyes were fiery, flashing blue
light, and they thought, but spoke not. "The jarl is
angry! Trouble cometh. We will watch if this is a
place of swords."</p>

<p>Then again they looked and he seemed taller and his
face was red and his eyes were full of glittering, and
some trembled, for they said each to his mate: "Seest
thou? It is the Odin wrath! Lift thy shield! War
cometh!"</p>

<p>Open swung a wide gate in the palisades and Svein
marched in, turning to beckon, while many warriors
closed in line with the company of Ulric and his Saxons;
but there were others who remained behind and prevented
some from closing the gate. Even as Sigurd had said,
when he lifted his hand and made a sign forty and four
more who were among Svein's garrison walked along,
spear in hand, until they seemed of one band with Ulric's.</p>

<p>But a sound came loudly, and then another&mdash;and another.</p>

<p>Svein stood still and blew upon his war horn, and it was
a command to his Danes that they should form as spearmen.
From behind a wide house rang joyously the note
of a Roman trumpet, and a line of legionaries, headed by
an officer, began to show itself. The third sound was
the angry word of Ulric, the son of Brander.</p>

<p>"Svein Jarl," he shouted, "I know thee. Thou art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Svein, son of Hedrig, my father's enemy. Me thou
wouldst betray to these wolves of Rome, but thou art not
able. I will give thee and them to the valkyrias."</p>

<p>"Hold thou, Ulric the Jarl," said Svein. "Thou art
caught in a trap. Thou shalt but give them up their
trireme. Thou mayest remain with me. Lay down thy
weapons. Thou and thine are prisoners. We may deal
with thee as we will."</p>

<p>So said the officer of the legionaries, mockingly, coming
forward, followed by his force. It was but fourscore
of men, and they were the garrison of this village, with
Svein and his Danes and his Jutlanders.</p>

<p>But Ulric was a good captain, and he and his Saxons
were stepping backward and the gate was still open.
Then fell quickly three men who strove to shut it, but
they went down by the spears of Sigurd's Saxons.</p>

<p>At that the Romans charged, and their charge was that
of warriors expecting to conquer; but Ulric, the son of
Brander, was taller by the head than any among them.
He waited not, but stepped out and met them in front of
the triangle formed by his men, and the flashing of his ax
was like the swiftness of the lightning, and his wrath was
terrible. Fast flew the spears on either side, but the
Saxons threw first, not waiting, and there were quickly
gaps in the Roman line.</p>

<p>Now charged Svein and his followers with shouts of
victory, save that a number of them were Northmen and
had no heart to this work. These fell back muttering,
and one of them said, loudly:</p>

<p>"Ulric, son of Odin, win thou this fight. The gods of
the North be with thee. I shed no blood in any such
quarrel. I am not a Roman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless the Saxons from <i>The Sword</i> had been too
much outnumbered if it had not been for Sigurd and his
sailors, for these fought like men who were to die if they
did not conquer.</p>

<p>Wonderful was the havoc wrought by the ax of Ulric,
and the Romans fell away from before him. Then
picked he up a pilum from the hand of a slain legionary
and he cast it with his might. Well had it been for
Svein the Jarl if his shield had been ready, for the pilum
passed through him at the waist and he would betray no
more Saxons. So fell the Roman officer at the hand of
Tostig, but the charge had been well made, and only half
of Ulric's own men were with him when his triangle was
beyond the gate, marching to the shore.</p>

<p>"Odin!" he shouted. "We have slain three for one!
Let us burn their keels."</p>

<p>But some of the men who had refused to fight for
Svein came around by another way and joined the
Saxons. Well was it, they said, that the Roman officer
had forced Svein to strike at once, for there were hundreds
of Danish warriors in the upland, and if these had
gathered, none of the crew of <i>The Sword</i> could have
escaped.</p>

<p>Even now there was preparation for swift following,
but Ulric's men took every boat, and the nearest keels
on the beach had already fire in them, put there by
Sigurd's men and the other Northmen who had deserted
Svein. These ships were also pushed out into the water
that they might burn more surely.</p>

<p>Within the palisades every Saxon who had fallen
wounded had already been slain by the Danes, but these
had been sorely smitten and they had lost their cunning jarl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Back now were Ulric and his men on board the trireme,
and count was made. "Thirteen heroes who went to the
land with us," he said, "have gone to Valhalla. With
them went six of Sigurd's company. Therefore, we have
ninety more strong men to handle so large a ship and to
hold spears in battle. The gods are with us, for they
have given us a brave combat and a victory."</p>

<p>The keels from the shore were burning hotly, and there
might be no pursuit, but Ulric commanded to lift the sail
of <i>The Sword</i>, the trireme, and to steer for the open sea.</p>

<p>"Now do I know," said Knud the Bear, "that Thor
came on board with his hammer. We needed more men
for the oars, to change hands when one company is
weary. It is good to have the gods with us in such a
case."</p>

<p>The wind blew off the land and the ship sailed away
gallantly, steering southward, and Ulric said to those who
asked him:</p>

<p>"We will not again set foot upon the shore of Britain.
Our work here is done. We will avoid all keels, friend
or foe, that may come near us. We go to the Middle
Sea, and our voyage, thus far, is prosperous."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sun shone brightly in the Northland all that day,
but Hilda sat by the fire in the hall of the house of Brander,
and she was shivering. Near her sat Oswald, the
harper.</p>

<p>"It is cold," she said. "This fire is but red coals and
ashes. Let them bring wood."</p>

<p>So sat she while they went for wood, and she gazed
mournfully into the great heap of gray and red, dotted
with dying embers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw not the ship," she muttered. "But I saw
Roman helmets. There is Ulric, and the Romans go
down before him. Where is the ship? I see her now,
and she is burning. How, then, can Ulric sail away? I
read it not, save that he is not slain. O that I could look
upon his face again before I go! How is it that I cannot
see the ship? But I knew that she would never come
again. It is well that he hath smitten the Romans so
soon. I will go to my room, for I am old and the ice is
out of the fiords and the buds are open and I have seen the
grass again. I need but the one token more and then
they may lay me away as I have bidden them. Ulric, my
beloved! Thou art as my son!"</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>Hilda of the Hundred Years.</small></span></h2>


<p>"Hast thou ever taken a keel into the Middle Sea, O
Sigurd, son of Thorold?" asked Ulric of his gigantic
friend.</p>

<p>They twain stood together upon the after deck and <i>The
Sword</i> was sailing but slowly, for the wind was contrary.</p>

<p>"More than once, O jarl," responded Sigurd. "I have
seen the Greek islands; I went up the Adriatic Sea with
Alfkel the Sea King. We had five keels, and we took
great spoil, but only three of our ships ever again touched
the shore of the Northland."</p>

<p>"What befell the two that returned not?" asked the
jarl. "Was it a fortune of the sea?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Sigurd. "In that sea the triremes of
Cæsar are too many. But thou hast need to consider thy
present course. Thou wilt do well to coast along the
land easterly after thy last sight of Britain. Between
these islands and Spain is a great sea full of storms. Try
it not with a straight passage, but go from point to point,
going on shore when thou wilt."</p>

<p>"I think it is good counsel," said the jarl. "I have
heard of that sea. As to the Adriatic, I would enter it
in due season, but first I would see Rome itself, if I
might."</p>

<p>"Not if thou go to its port in a keel thou hast won from
Cæsar," said Sigurd. "That were but to offer them thy
head. Thou wilt do better among the islands and toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the great land that is called Africa. There dwell the
black men, and in the inland there are giants wonderful to
see; and also there are powerful magicians."</p>

<p>"I care not much for them," said Ulric, "although I am
curious about giants. Tell me all thou wilt of thy voyages."</p>

<p>Willingly did Sigurd tell, and he had seen many wonderful
things in the southlands.</p>

<p>"I shall gladly see them again," he said; and even the
next day did this talk go on, for a gale blew and <i>The
Sword</i> went before it with but one small sail lifted.</p>

<p>Sigurd's men were now as if they had been with Ulric
from the first, and by them a matter had been told which
was now more fully given by the tall viking.</p>

<p>"Svein concealed it from me," he said, "but an old
Dane warned me in private. The Roman officer of that
garrison was but waiting for the arrival of more legionaries,
for Svein's men might not be depended on in such
an undertaking. It would have included thee and thine.
All who did not belong to Svein or who were minded to
leave him were to have been given up as war prisoners to
the Romans."</p>

<p>"That they might lose their heads!" exclaimed Ulric.
"I am glad he is slain! It was a dark purpose."</p>

<p>"Thou hast not read it rightly, nevertheless," said
Sigurd. "Hast thou not heard of the great games and
shows of Cæsar and of his chief officers?"</p>

<p>"Many a thing have I heard," replied Ulric, "but not
from any man who had ever witnessed the things he told
of. Hast thou seen?"</p>

<p>"No, Jarl Ulric," said Sigurd, "but I have listened to
brave men who have looked in upon such things. As to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
one affair, we learned little by little that the proconsul of
Britain desired good swordsmen to contend with his
trained slaves and with his wild beasts. It was also for
his profit to send Saxons as presents to Cæsar to be slain
in the great shows of Rome. For this purpose all we
were to be entrapped and caged as soon as their hunting
party should become strong enough to take us alive. We
were to be set upon unawares. Therefore did we sleep
by watches, fully armed, for the thing was to be done in
the night. So was the idea of Svein, the treacherous,
concerning all thy crew."</p>

<p>"He will entrap no more Saxons henceforth," said the
jarl. "As for me, I would gladly fight a lion or a tiger.
It would be great sport. I will try if I may meet these
wonderful beasts before I return to the Northland.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt meet thy lion with full armor," responded
Sigurd, "but it is not so in these games of the Romans.
There is no fair fighting. They arm thee as they see fit.
Often thou art not matched with one man or with one
beast, but with odds, that they may see thee overcome or
torn. This is their delight concerning prisoners and
malefactors which cost them little. They spare their
dens of animals and their purchased gladiators that they
may more cheaply see much blood. But there is worse
than this among them, for they use the scourge upon us,
and a man would rather die ten times than be made to feel
the stroke of a whip, as if he were a slave."</p>

<p>"If I were indeed lashed," growled Ulric, "it were well
for that man, even were he Cæsar, not to come near me in
after time if there were a blade within my reach. There
might come a sure cast of a spear, and I throw far."</p>

<p>"This scourging," said Sigurd, "is to break the proud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>spirit of such as thou art. I think thine or mine would
not be so destroyed, but rather a red fire kindled in ashes
that would smolder for a time. But they know us well,
these Romans. A captive Saxon is chained as an untameable
wild beast until they push him out of his cage
into the arena."</p>

<p>"So slay we all Romans!" exclaimed the jarl. "We
will count them but wolves. But I will see many other
cities if I may not go to Rome. The wind changeth and
I think a storm is upon us."</p>

<p>Soon fiercely howled around them an angry north
wind, tossing the sea in great surges, but the trireme
proved herself stanch and well behaved. She held on her
way swiftly. Often saw they the land, but after one night
more Sigurd called Ulric to a bulwark, at the dawn, and
he pointed first westerly.</p>

<p>"Seest thou," he said, "yonder high white cliffs? We
are in the narrow sea between Britain and Gaul. We
have been driven about too much and we have expended
days. Now we may drive southward and we may not
meet other keels often. The Britons of Gaul are like
those of the islands. They are not sea-goers, and they
are all under the rule of Cæsar."</p>

<p>"We have no need to strike them," said the jarl.
"They are not our errand. We will but sail on as we
have planned. Thou hast taught me many things. I
thank thee."</p>

<p>The day went by and <i>The Sword</i> drew near the land at
times, but it was better to keep well away from an unknown
coast. All the crew were pleased to discover how
swiftly they might travel and how readily they might turn
so large a vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"She will do well in battle," they said.</p>

<p>As to the three banks of oars, the jarl angered some by
his urgency in compelling all to practice their use, that
they might become well skilled.</p>

<p>"He is a hard master of a ship," said some. "Do we
not know what to do with oars?" The older men were
better satisfied, and they also studied the handling of a
trireme.</p>

<p>The next day <i>The Sword</i> was not far out from the
westerly shore of Gaul and a thing came to Ulric the Jarl
as he stood upon the after deck steering and watching the
land. He was thinking deeply, also, concerning the gods,
and he was remembering those persons whom he had left
behind him in the Northland which was now so far away.</p>

<p>"What is this?" arose a sudden inquiry in his mind.
"I am not alone! I think that one sitteth by me. I have
felt the touch of her hand upon my hair, stroking it.
There hath been no voice, but the hand is the hand of a
woman and I know it well of old. I will wait and see if
she will speak to me. I have hungered for speech with
some whom I may not see. I think that of the unseen
ones there must be a great multitude and that their land
must be wide, but no man knoweth what it may be like.
In it is the city of Asgard. There is Valhalla, and there
dwell the heroes from innumerable battles. I shall not
ever be fully contented until I hear the valkyrias call my
name. But first I would have speech with one of these
strange gods of the southlands. The Grecians have
many, and so have the Romans. I have willed, also, to
look upon the face of the god of the Jews, for he is said
to be a strong one and very beautiful. O thou that
touchest, I pray thee touch me again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind went softly by him and there came a low
whisper in his ear so that he heard it thus, as if it had
been a voice:</p>

<p>"Son of Odin, I have passed. Have passed."</p>

<p>More heard he not, nor did he see any, but at that
hour there was a great silence in the house of Brander in
the Northland.</p>

<p>In her chair sat Hilda, as she was wont, but she was
very white, and her eyes were shut. Around her stood
the household, save that Oswald, the harper, sat with his
head bowed upon his harp. Not many men were there,
and the women and the maidens did but look at one another
and at Hilda, for they knew not whether she were
living or dead, and they feared to put hands upon her.</p>

<p>Then opened she her eyes and her lips parted.</p>

<p>"I have seen him," she said, "but the ship is not <i>The
Sword</i>. I have been as if I were asleep, but it was no
dream. Where my heart is there was I, and I will go to
him again. Now, when I sleep again, put ye my veil over
my face. Let me not fall from my chair, but place me
upon my bier and make ready to carry me to the cleft of
the rocks. If it may be, I will speak once more before I
go."</p>

<p>So went she to sleep and they covered her face, but now
the women wailed loudly and all the men of the household
were sent for to come to the hall.</p>

<p>"Hilda of the hundred winters hath seen the last outing
of the ice," the women said, "and now the grass and the
leaves have come. She goeth down to her own and she
will see the gods."</p>

<p>A litter was made and they bore her to her room, for
she had given the older women instructions and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
knew what to do in such a case. The household men
came, but they did not stay in the house, for Oswald spoke
to them and they went out with him to the place of tombs.</p>

<p>The low hill on which were the standing stones had a
face of broken rock seaward. In the middle of this face
leaned a tall, flat stone, a slab of limestone, which had
been worked to smoothness on its outer side. Upon this
surface were many runes graven, in lines and columns,
and some of them were like small pictures, and more were
like letters of words that were to be read. The stone was
exceedingly heavy, and strong men worked with wooden
levers to lay it aside without injuring it. When that was
done there could be seen a chasm, as if the rock had been
cloven to make an entrance for any who would go in. At
this the men looked, but as yet they kept their feet away
from it.</p>

<p>All over the Northland there are such tombs as was
this of the house of Brander the Brave, the sea king, and
in them are the bones of the mighty. But in some, as in
this, are not buried the heroes after whose names the
tombs are called, for they fell upon far-away battlefields
or in fights at sea, but at their tombs were made sacrifices
to the gods, nevertheless, and the songs to the dead are to
be sung there by their kindred. If any man have a hero
son, to this place must he come to speak to his father and
to the Asas, or he will be accounted nidering and unfit to
be a jarl and a leader of men.</p>

<p>Low had sunk the sun when a procession walked slowly
away from the house of Brander. The men of best rank
and name were proud to be permitted to bear the bier of
Hilda, as if she had been a princess; for she was of the
race of Odin and she had talked with the gods for a hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>dred
years. Therefore, also, every man wore his full
armor; but of the women there were some who carried
goblets and pitchers which had been Hilda's, of pottery
and of bronze and of silver and of beaten gold. Others
there were who carried her best garments, rending them
as they came.</p>

<p>"She is not to be burned," said Oswald. "She is to be
laid in the inner crypt, with her feet toward the east.
Her coffin is of wood, and it was in her room, but I have
brought it. Let her be placed therein."</p>

<p>It was a long box made of planks of the fir tree, and it
was large enough. In it did they lay the body of Hilda,
taking it from the bier. Then the strong men bore it into
the cleft of the rocks, but not many were permitted to follow
and see. Three fathoms deep was the cleft, and then
it widened, making a small room, and this could be seen
well, for some of the men bore torches. There were
other coffins, and there were bones and skulls uncovered
at the sides and in the corners. There were stones also,
set up in the form of coffins, and in them were bones and
many good weapons, as if to each man had been given
shield, ax, sword, spear, helmet, and mail, and vessels of
pottery and of metal, with good garments. But the arms
and armor were for the greater part marred, bent, broken,
and the garments were rent.</p>

<p>"Speak not," said Oswald, "but put down the coffin of
Hilda here. The runes on the rock beside it were graven
by herself for the memory of Brander the Brave, for she
loved him well."</p>

<p>In the coffin were some things placed. Upon it was
laid a plank of fir. On this, then, and on the earth at the
head were arranged all other matters brought by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
women. Every man walked out then except Oswald, and
he stood still and spoke to Hilda, but she answered him
not. Again he spoke, calling her by name, and those
without, in the cleft and beyond it, heard him, and they
listened well, but they heard no other voice than his.</p>

<p>"Hilda!" he said again. "Hilda of the hundred winters,
daughter of Odin, what sayest thou to Oswald, thy
friend?"</p>

<p>They heard no answer, but Oswald came forth and
bade them place the stone.</p>

<p>"Set it well," he said, "for it will not be moved again.
The house of Brander is ended. There will be no other
who will have the right to be buried behind the stone."</p>

<p>None answered him, but the women whispered sadly to
one another: "What of Ulric the Jarl?"</p>

<p>The men followed Oswald to the house, for a feast
had been prepared in honor of the daughter of Odin, and
the tables were set. Other harpers had come, with chiefs
and men of rank, but no other harp might sound until
after that of Oswald.</p>

<p>The central fire had gone out, but he had bidden them
leave the ash heap. It was high and gray, and he sat
down by it, bringing his harp nearer. All who were
there had heard him often, but never before, they said,
had they heard him touch his harp as he did now. The
music was wonderful, and with it arose his voice in marvelous
power, for he sang of heroes, and of gods, and
of the unseen lands where the gods live. Also, before he
ceased, he sang of Ulric the Jarl and of the ship <i>The
Sword</i>, as if even now he could see her going into battle
and hear the warhorn of the son of Brander.</p>

<p>So was the passing of Hilda of the hundred years.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Jew and the Greek.</small></span></h2>


<p>"O jarl," said Sigurd, the son of Thorolf, "many days
have passed since we entered this sea. Thou hast pleased
thy crew by landings at harbors. They have also smitten
quiet people against thy will, and uselessly. They are
hard to govern."</p>

<p>"The thirst of blood cometh upon them," said the jarl.
"I would not slay any without good need. What knowest
thou of this place where we are?"</p>

<p>"It is the gate of the world, O jarl," said Sigurd. "We
have passed all Spain and much too long time have we
been in our voyaging. This great cliff upon the Spanish
shore is the rock I named to thee at the beginning.
Southward, across this narrow strait, is Africa. The
Romans name this rock the Pillars of Hercules. He is
of their old heroes, a strong one, a half god. Not as
Thor or Odin. He is of the giants."</p>

<p>Many more things said Sigurd, and the vikings
thronged around to hear. Of the older men, also, were
many who knew this place and who had words to speak.
The younger men were exultant and their speech was
boisterous; but the face of the jarl grew harder as he
heard them, for they had offended him often by their
deeds in Gaul and on the coast of Spain, and by their
cruelties to peaceable merchant sailors whose keels <i>The
Sword</i> had overtaken. "I am made a pirate against my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
will," he had said of these things. "The greatest of the
sea kings are not so, for they have many friends and
tributaries among the peoples and islands of the Middle
Sea." Nevertheless, he now spoke loudly to all.</p>

<p>"Beyond this cape," he said, "is the Middle Sea, which
was from the first the destination of our voyage. Glad
am I to have come so far out into the world. From this
place onward we are as men who sail into a battle. So
will every man bind himself to his obedience, lest his neck
shall feel a seax."</p>

<p>This was the law of the Northmen upon the sea, and
none might complain; but the jarl's hand was upon his
sword hilt, and some of the men turned to look at each
other for a moment.</p>

<p>Very smooth was the water, for there was no wind.
The air was soft and warm. Only one bank of the oars
propelled <i>The Sword</i>. She was now in no haste, and all
who were on board of her felt their hearts beat with rejoicing.
To most of them this was their first long war
cruise, and all things were new, so that they watched
eagerly for that which might be next to come.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Tostig the Red, "beyond all doubt we
shall soon see triremes of the Romans. Will they not at
once inquire concerning us? Wilt thou avoid such a keel
or wilt thou hasten into a battle?"</p>

<p>"I have considered well," said the jarl. "Of a merchantman
we may exact tribute, but we need not always
destroy. It is not the way of sea kings. Prisoners we
take not any. A warship of Cæsar we must strike in her
middle, without warning, that she may go down speedily
and that too wide a report of our coming may not be
given to those who would pursue us with a fleet. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
not, after such delays, that we are the first of the vikings
this year in the Middle Sea."</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Knud the Bear, "care not for that overmuch.
We will but go the farther into the sea. I am
with thee in thy saying that we must sail to the eastern
shore of all these waters."</p>

<p>The jarl lifted his war horn and blew long and loudly
and his face grew brighter.</p>

<p>"To Asgard!" he shouted. "To the city of the gods!
And we will smite the Romans."</p>

<p>Shield clashed on shield. Horn after horn was blown.
The vikings shouted joyously and Sigurd the son of
Thorolf lifted his great voice in a song of war.</p>

<p>"Easterly!" commanded Ulric to him who was steering
<i>The Sword</i>. "The gods of the Northland are with us
and our voyage hath been well prospered."</p>

<p>On floated the good ship, but she seemed to be sailing
over a sea of peace, so quiet and so beautiful were both
sky and water. An hour went by, and now Ulric, sitting
on the fore deck, sprang suddenly to his feet, for there
came a shout down from Wulf the Skater above the sail
upon the foremast:</p>

<p>"O jarl! A sail! Eastward. And no other sail is
with her."</p>

<p>"She is our prize!" shouted the jarl. "We may not
fail of taking the first keel that we meet, whatever she
may be. A man to every oar! But let those who hold
the spears put on Roman helmets speedily. Open the
sheaves of arrows. Bring out spears in abundance."</p>

<p>Other commands he gave, and there was no discontented
man on board; none who was not willing to do the
bidding of his jarl in battle. Then were they glad to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
led by a son of Odin; and a hard ruler in a quiet time may
be the captain men seek after if an enemy is nearing.</p>

<p>The jarl bade the rowers to row, but steadily, not wasting
their strength, while the Roman helmets were brought
out from the stores of <i>The Sword</i>, and the vikings
laughed merrily at each other in this strange disguising.</p>

<p>Very soon they were near enough to learn the kind
and the action of this keel which they were to contend
with. She was not now attempting to either come or go,
but she was drifting along over the calm water with her
sails flapping lazily against her mast. The vikings might
see, however, that her decks were full of armed men, and
that she was a larger vessel than had ever been seen in the
seas of the North. Vast was her length and breadth, and
she carried five banks of oars instead of three, for this was
one of the new quinqueremes which Cæsar had builded
for the conveyance of his legions. She was planned,
therefore, more for carrying than for speed, although her
weight and force might be terrible to crash against another
vessel. She was high above the water, like a tower
that would be difficult to scale. She had two masts, and
on these were bulwarked platforms for archers and
slingers. She was as much more than a match for Ulric's
keel as had this been for <i>The Sword</i>, the first, the low-built
ship with which he had sailed from the Northland
behind the outing ice, only that the quinquereme was less
readily to be turned about.</p>

<p>The officer in command of the Roman warship knew no
fear of any foe afloat, so sure was he of the superior
strength of his vessel, and now he could have no suspicion
that an enemy of Rome had come in at this time of the
year through the gates of Hercules. He came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
after deck of the quinquereme when his outlooks called
him, and his answer to them was haughty.</p>

<p>"Why did ye disturb me?" he asked. "It is but one of
the triremes of Licinius coming back with tidings for
Cæsar. We may hail her, in her passing, but we may
not hinder her. Cæsar is careful of the bearers of his
messages. Men die early who meddle with that which
doth not concern them."</p>

<p>No change was made, therefore, in the handling of the
quinquereme. The rowers sat idly at their places, ready
for any orders which might come, but allowing their oars,
longer and shorter, to hang in the water, or to rest hauled
inboard.</p>

<p>Now there came wind enough to fill the sail, and she
slipped along better, while the sailing master came and
stood by the haughty centurion.</p>

<p>"They are in haste," he said. "They row swiftly."</p>

<p>"Well they may," replied the officer, "whether Licinius
hath had good fortune or whether the fates have been
against him. I would not be sent to Britain. Too many
have gone to ruin on that island."</p>

<p>"It is a bad place," said the seaman, "and all those seas
are full of Saxons. They are fierce barbarians, but they
make good gladiators. I would crucify them all."</p>

<p>"Never spare thou a Saxon," said the centurion.
"They are food for the sword. Slay every one thou findest
on land or sea. Mars be my witness, I will spare not
one."</p>

<p>For life or for death, therefore, was the swift coming
of <i>The Sword</i>. The Saxons must overcome the quinquereme,
or escape her in some manner, or they must die
without mercy, and this they knew well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"A strong force on board of her," said the centurion,
as <i>The Sword</i> drew nearer. "But I see no standard save
an eagle on the fore deck. She hath no officers of rank,
and that is strange. I will hail her. Sound thou thy
trumpet, trumpeter!"</p>

<p>Loudly rang out the trumpet call, and it was answered
by a trumpet from <i>The Sword</i>. But here too was a mystery.
The viking who blew was better used to his war
horn, and he knew not that instead of a peaceful greeting
he had sounded the notes that bid a Roman legion close
with an enemy, to win or die.</p>

<p>The centurion sprang to his feet, for he had been seated.</p>

<p>"Rowers!" he shouted, "to your places! Here is a
strange matter! There is evil tidings!"</p>

<p>Other swift orders followed, and every legionary on
board the quinquereme was at his post, for the Romans
are not easily to be taken by surprise because of their
strict discipline and their rule for perpetual readiness by
day or night.</p>

<p>"She is a smaller craft than ours," said the sailing
master, "but she is a good one. I know her well, and her
sign is Minerva. Who now commandeth her I know
not."</p>

<p>In that she was so well known as one of the triremes of
the Roman fleet in British waters was now a gift of the
gods to <i>The Sword</i> and to the Saxons. Not the centurion
nor his officers nor any seaman or legionary on
board the quinquereme had any thought or suspicion of
that which was to come.</p>

<p>Onward flashed the swift, strong vessel, the oars of the
Northmen biting well the sparkling sea. Fiercely rang
the Roman trumpet, warning them to change their course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
lest there should be a collision. Hoarse were the angry
shouts of the astonished centurion, but vain were his too-long
delayed orders to his rowers and his steersman.</p>

<p>On the fore deck of <i>The Sword</i> stood now a tall shape,
wearing indeed the helmet of a Roman, but putting to his
lips a war horn of the North. Beside him stood what
seemed a giant brandishing a spear. The blast was
sounded and then sped the spear. A hundred more were
hurled from <i>The Sword</i> at the Romans on the decks of
the quinquereme. The viking rowers pulled with their
might.</p>

<p>Crash! With a breaking of timbers, a braying of
horns, a chorus of mocking war cries, the quinquereme
was smitten amidships with a force which threw her
legionaries prostrate and sent her rowers from their oars.</p>

<p>The centurion was pierced by the spear of Sigurd.
The steersman fell by a heavy pebble cast by Knud the
Bear. The sailing master went down twice smitten.</p>

<p>Up to the masthead of <i>The Sword</i> shot the White
Horse flag of the Saxons, and the good ship sprang backward
with a great rebound, helped quickly by the rowers.</p>

<p>"We have stricken her!" shouted Ulric. "The sea
poureth into her. Back! Strike not again! It is
enough!"</p>

<p>As the lightning from a clear sky, so was the deathblow
given to the pride and strength of the quinquereme. As
a warrior stabbed to the heart was she as she leaned over,
and as the fatal blue tide poured in through the deep
wound in her side. There was no stanching it. There
was no hope. They who had purposed to slay all Saxons
were themselves to die. On the decks and at the bulwarks,
amazed, confounded, the Roman soldiers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
sailors stood and gazed in silence at their utterly mysterious
destroyer. Here was a riddle of the fates and furies
which none might read. They knew not even the flag of
this strange pirate keel. They only knew that they were
going down.</p>

<p>On the stern of the quinquereme stood three men who
were not in armor. They were bearded men and they
wore turbans, and they spoke to each other in another
tongue than the Latin.</p>

<p>"We may escape," one of them said. "The god of
Israel hath heard. We are not to be crucified. Let us
plunge in and go to yonder ship from Tarshish. Ben
Ezra, what sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"Follow me," said Ben Ezra, "ere this accursed quinquereme
goeth down bearing us with it. On this side,
while the Romans are gazing. Take each two short oars.
We have somewhat to bear with us. Get beyond a spear
cast as soon as we may."</p>

<p>He was a short man, and old, but his eyes were bright
and he seemed a brave one. His two companions were
youths. Into the water they slipped silently, as he had
said, and they swam well, partly upheld by the pieces of
wood.</p>

<p><i>The Sword</i> was not receding, but her rowers were pulling
easily as Wulf the Skater steered her around and past
the quinquereme. No more spears were thrown nor did
any arrows fly, but there was a sounding of war horns.</p>

<p>Brave must have been the trumpeter of the legionaries,
for he lifted his trumpet and answered defiantly, even
while the water rushed in through the fatal gap in the
wooden wall of his sinking vessel.</p>

<p>"We shall have no prisoners," said Knud the Bear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
"I would I knew if they had taken any. What if captured
Saxons were on board of her?"</p>

<p>"Not at this season of the year," said Sigurd. "But
what are those? Look yonder! The Romans wear no
turbans. O jarl."</p>

<p>"Bid them on board!" shouted Ulric. "I would question
them. Throw them a rope!"</p>

<p>It was a long thong of twisted hide that was cast out
toward Ben Ezra and his companions, but it came too
late. In a moment their escape had been seen by the
legionaries. They were true to their soldier discipline.
They themselves must die, but it was their duty to prevent
the departure from the quinquereme of any prisoners.
Such as attempted it must be slain. So the pila flew fast
and even arrows were sent.</p>

<p>"Ben Ezra, I am smitten!" gasped one of the younger
swimmers.</p>

<p>"Thou?" groaned Ben Ezra; but in an instant more,
he added: "O God of Hosts! My son also! My only
son! My Benjamin!"</p>

<p>"Father!" cried out the second youth, in agony, "the
spear of the heathen! I die! I die!"</p>

<p>"My son!" again mourned Ben Ezra. "I care not to
live! Let me perish with thee!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he had grasped the thong of twisted hide
and the instinct of self-preservation was strong enough
to make him cling to it. Moreover, he had taken three
of the short oars, instead of only two, and on these he was
buoying up what seemed a small casket of wood. He
was doing so with difficulty, and now he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The jewels! The gold! I must not lose them.
They are priceless. The centurion knoweth not that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
have them. Not only mine are here, but the prætor's
also. O Jehovah of Hosts! Thou hast smitten the
heathen! That spear fell short. Ha!"</p>

<p>A pilum struck the oars and Ben Ezra struggled hard
for his treasure, but he succeeded in retaining it.</p>

<p>Down sank the two who had been stricken, and in a
moment more a strong hand of a viking grasped the old
man by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Courage! Thou art safe!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"This first!" said Ben Ezra, trying to hand him the
casket. "It is worth their quinquereme! Ye are Northmen.
I am a Jew of Salonica. The Roman robbers
plundered my ship unlawfully, and me they meant to
crucify, the better to claim my goods. Help me in. I
am faint. O my son!"</p>

<p>They pulled him up over the bulwark with some difficulty,
but he spoke not nor did he seem to see anything
until he was sure that his casket was in the hands of Ulric
the Jarl.</p>

<p>"Open it not now, O captain of the Saxons," said Ben
Ezra. "I have much to say to thee. When yonder
Roman keel goeth down I am no longer in peril, for I
have kept the law. But the Prætor Sergius of Spain
and the commanders of the fleet rob whomsoever they
will. Praise God, she sinketh fast!"</p>

<p>It was even so. The quinquereme was settling in the
water and her crew could cast spears no more. They did
but stand still and gaze at the sea and at their strange
enemy, but some of them even now called loudly upon
their gods, as if there could be any help from them.</p>

<p>She was a splendid vessel, and her figurehead was a
gilded Neptune with a trident which looked as if it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
be of gold. Rich indeed were her carvings and the very
handles of her oars were graven and gilded. She was
high at prow and stern, a castle of the sea, and the wonder
was that she had been cloven at a blow. A lighter
vessel with a ram less sharp would perhaps have rebounded
without doing serious harm, but the beak of <i>The
Sword</i> was like a vast spearhead and it had been driven
hard by the strong arms of the Saxons and by the weight
of the trireme.</p>

<p>The middle parts of the foundering ship could no
longer be occupied, and the ill-fortuned men who were to
perish were now crowded densely fore and aft. Even
now, however, the legionaries preserved their discipline,
and they slew some of the hired rowers who pressed them
in too disorderly a manner. These were deaths which
were but somewhat hastened, yet military order was restored
thereby, for the rowers feared the strokes of the
pila and the broadswords.</p>

<p>"They go!" muttered Ben Ezra. "So perish all who
afflict the chosen people. Rome will yet fall before the
sword of Judah and the spear of Israel. Jehovah standeth
for his elect. He will have vengeance upon the heathen.
He will smite through kings in the day of his wrath."</p>

<p>"O Ulric the Jarl," said Sigurd, "thou mayest trust the
Jew. He hateth Rome as we do."</p>

<p>Then came Ulric nearer, still watching the quinquereme,
but he spoke words to Ben Ezra in a tongue that
those who stood by understood not.</p>

<p>"Father Abraham!" exclaimed the old man, "where
didst thou learn Hebrew? I like thee well for this.
After yonder quinquereme goeth down thou hast cause to
consult with me. There are matters thou knowest not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Odin!" exclaimed Ulric. "Watch! She is pitching
forward! They are falling!"</p>

<p>In a mass together, as the decks slanted, plunged the
overcrowded Romans. It was of no avail to struggle or
to thrust with sharp weapons. Angrily, loudly, in his
last desperate valor, blew the trumpeter his final defiance,
but as the blast ended the prow of the quinquereme went
madly under, lifting the stern out of water for a moment.
Then went up a great cry and quickly naught could be
seen save a few heads of swimmers dotting the blue
water.</p>

<p>The helmets disappeared first because of the weight of
armor, but the Saxons cast no spears at any who remained,
and some who were bareheaded seemed to be
swimming well.</p>

<p>"He hath golden hair," said Sigurd, pointing at one of
these. "He is no Roman. I will call to him in Greek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bid him come," said Ulric, "if so be he is not a Roman.
He may live."</p>

<p>Sigurd sent to the swimmer a few words in a smoothly
sounding tongue, and the golden-haired youth struck out
for the trireme, but he was followed by twain who were
dark and who cursed him in Latin. Well for him that he
was the better swimmer, for they strove to grapple him
that he might die with them. He might not even then
have fully escaped but that Ulric knew their meaning and
said to Tostig the Red:</p>

<p>"I have no spear! Smite those two Romans and save
the Greek."</p>

<p>Not one spear but twenty sped in answer to that command,
and the youth came nearer alone, for there were
none to follow him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was a rower," said Ben Ezra. "He is a slave of
the centurion. He is from Corinth. It is perilous to
spare him, lest he might tell of this thy doing."</p>

<p>"What harm?" asked Ulric. "Can the Romans do
more than destroy? I will myself tell them that this is
the third of their warships that I have taken from them."</p>

<p>"Thou sailest in one," replied Ben Ezra, glancing
around him. "Thou and thine are men of valor. But
the like of this hath never before been seen. A Saxon
crew in a Roman trireme fighting the ships of Cæsar!
Mayest thou have a fleet and smite them in the Tiber
itself! Now sail thou on, for there is another quinquereme
and she may not be far away. Avoid her, lest
thou fall into a snare of presumption."</p>

<p>"Not I," laughed Ulric. "We have done enough this
day. Come thou and talk with me, and then I will have
speech with the Greek."</p>

<p>The young Corinthian was now aft among the men,
and Sigurd was talking freely with him. There were
others of the older vikings who had learned words of the
Grecian tongue, and they, too, were both speaking and
hearing.</p>

<p>Into a cabin under the fore deck went Ulric and Ben
Ezra, and there they were alone, for none was permitted
to follow them.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Storm in the Middle Sea.</small></span></h2>


<p>Wide but not high was the space which was inclosed
under the fore deck of the trireme <i>The Sword</i>. Beneath
its floor was much room for stowage. The other decks,
also, had under them good cabins, suited to many purposes.
The decking amidships, whereon tier above tier
were made the seats and standing places of the rowers,
had openings covered by hatches. Down through these,
by ladders, might be entered a great hollow, and this was
for cargo and for sleeping room. Very different was all
this from the planning of any vessels which hitherto had
been builded in the Northland. In the cabins under the
fore deck were bunks for sailors and soldiers, but all the
garnishing was plain. Here, also, there were stores of
weapons, with boxes and bales of merchandise. The
cabins under the after deck were divided and garnished
for the uses of officers and men of rank who might at any
time be on board.</p>

<p>It was not long after the sinking of the quinquereme
that the jarl and the Jew, Ben Ezra, stood face to face in
a small room under the fore deck. Steadily looked Ulric
into the face of the Jew.</p>

<p>"He is old, but he is not aged," was his thought concerning
this man. "He is tall and broad and strong and
heavily bearded. His face proveth for him high intelligence,
but it hath deep marks which one may read. I
think him a subtle man and a keeper of secrets. He is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
man of rank among his own people, for common men are
not as he is. I am glad of him."</p>

<p>"O jarl of the Saxons," said Ben Ezra, "I have blessed
thee in my soul, by Jehovah my God, that thou hast utterly
smitten to death these Romans. Thou didst wisely
not to spare any, as they would not have spared thee or
thine. Thou mayest be sure that if so much as one of
them were on board thy ship, he were a danger. I will
tell thee of myself."</p>

<p>"Say on," said Ulric, "but speak truly, that it may be
well with thee."</p>

<p>"Leader of men," said Ben Ezra, "my life hangeth
upon thy life. I am one with thee. I do but take care for
myself in that I am truthful. I was informed against in
Spain to the prætor because I was rich. I was seized, but
I and my son and a Jewish youth, the son of a rabbi,
escaped from our destroyers. My ship was ready laden
and we sailed in the night. The quinquereme was faster
and she overtook us. All were slain but we three, for
they were overfull with rowers and soldiers and cared not
for more slaves. Even to have escaped the prætor was to
be doomed to crucifixion; but they had not yet scourged
us, waiting an opportunity. O my son! My son! That he
might have been spared! For they have slain his mother
and his brethren. He was my Benjamin! My youngest
son! The joy of my heart!"</p>

<p>"He was slain by a spear," said Ulric, to comfort him.
"He died not on a bed, that thou shouldst mourn so much
for him. Thy god hath done well by thee. I saw him
swimming bravely till the pilum struck him."</p>

<p>"And the youth, the son of the rabbi Joseph, of Jerusalem!"
groaned Ben Ezra. "What shall I say to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
father? A fair boy and well favored! They are merciless,
for he had done them no wrong."</p>

<p>"Little careth a Roman for that," growled Ulric.
"Who is this Greek?"</p>

<p>"He was a bondslave of the centurion of the band of
legionaries on the quinquereme," said Ben Ezra. "His
father was a rich man in Corinth, but the proconsul lusted
after his goods and he was accused. He was but slain,
not crucified, but his older sons went to the arena to feed
lions, and this Lysias, for his youth and beauty, was kept
alive, if a man be indeed living who is slave to a Roman.
Thou mayest trust him that he hated his master."</p>

<p>"For what part didst thou intend to sail," asked Ulric;
"seeing the Romans could have found thee anywhere on
the earth?"</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Ben Ezra. "I were safe if once I
were in Judea or Galilee."</p>

<p>"And where are they?" asked Ulric.</p>

<p>"At the eastern shore of this sea, as thou shouldst
know," said Ben Ezra, "is the land of my people. In it
are many cities and mountains, and its provinces are under
different governors. He who is threatened by one
needs but to flee to another if he can take a gift with him.
I have a gift for thee wherewith thou couldst buy a consul,
if so be he had no opportunity to rob thee. My goods, all
but one casket, went down with the quinquereme. In
that casket are gems of my own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want them not," said Ulric. "They are not my
prizes. I struck no blow for them. Keep thou that
which is thine own. I am a Saxon, not a pirate."</p>

<p>"Thou art a sea king," replied Ben Ezra. "I have had
many dealings with such as thou art. They are not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
other men, for they keep faith with strangers. But this,
also, I tell thee: as the Roman ship began to fill the centurion
went mad, it seemed, for he took from his crypt in
his cabin his own jewels and some that the prætor would
have sent to Cæsar to buy a pardon for some of his offenses.
These, also, went into my casket, and he placed it
on the deck and by it a small bag of gold. With aid of
three oars for floats and with strong swimming I rescued
all, and here they are. Even the centurion knew not their
value."</p>

<p>"I know what gold coins are," said Ulric, as the bag
was opened before him. "Oswald the Harper taught me
concerning money. Are these thine?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Ben Ezra, "they are thine, for they belonged
to the centurion. Of the stones I will show thee.
That sardonyx is mine. It was graven in Egypt, and on
it are words of the wisdom of the priests of Isis."</p>

<p>"Runes like Hilda's!" exclaimed Ulric, gazing earnestly
upon the characters which blended with the varying tints
of the beautifully polished stone. "Canst thou read them?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Ben Ezra, "but this sardius, also, is
mine. It is a stone of the temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem,
and on it is his most holy name. Touch it not, for thou
art of the heathen."</p>

<p>"What have I to do," asked Ulric, "with a matter belonging
to your god? I have thought that I would like
to see him some day. I am sailing to find the city of the
gods. He will be there, perhaps, among them."</p>

<p>"He is a great King above all gods," said Ben Ezra,
reverently, but his eyes were dwelling upon the glowing,
blood-red tint of the inestimable gem which bore the holy
name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Odin!" exclaimed Ulric. "I think your god would be
on good terms with the gods of the North, for I have
heard well of him. Thou mayest tell me more about him
some day. But now thou mayest tie up thy gems and
give me mine. I have the ship to command, and I care
not overmuch for stones."</p>

<p>"My sardius alone is worth thy trireme," said Ben
Ezra, frankly. "Keep thou thy treasure carefully and a
day may come when it will be of use to thee. Divide not
with thy men. Give them other matters."</p>

<p>Ulric laughed loudly as he responded: "Good faith is
kept among us, O Jew, but my vikings are welcome to all
I possess. The ship itself is theirs, if I am slain, and
they will carry to my own house anything that belongs to
me. We are not thieves, like the men of the southlands."</p>

<p>Ben Ezra looked into his face and said: "Verily thou
art my friend! I have not met any like unto thee. I
would thou mayest go with me to the city of my God, to
Jerusalem. There is his temple and it is the wonder of
the earth."</p>

<p>"So have I heard," said Ulric, joyously. "I think I
will go and see. But whither shall I steer at this hour?"</p>

<p>"Toward the coast of Africa," said Ben Ezra.
"Thither was I sailing. There are old harbors there for
which the Romans take no care. In them are pirate
peoples, foes of Rome, ancient Carthaginians, Egyptians,
Libyans; but thou wilt be friends with them."</p>

<p>"<i>The Sword</i> will sail for Africa," said Ulric; "but as
for pirates, we will see to that matter."</p>

<p>"Verily there is none like thee!" exclaimed the Jew.
"Thou art like Saul, the son of Kish!"</p>

<p>Into a small sack of deerskin did Ulric put his jewels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
looking at them one by one and admiring their great
beauty.</p>

<p>"Never saw I such before," he said. "They are such
as kings wear in the southlands. I think the gods must
have many of them. These white ones are pearls, and
they are lustrous. The green stones are emeralds."</p>

<p>"They are of great value," said Ben Ezra. "Especially
that large, flat-faced one. It is engraven with the sign
of the sun, and it came therefore from Persia. Thy
pearls are from the East, and they are wonderful, but
some of mine are as large."</p>

<p>"I will keep the gold in my belt pouch," said Ulric,
"and thou shalt teach me to pay with it."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not be cheated," said Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>Then he took his closed casket with him and walked
to the after cabin, for in that was to be his abiding place,
and he said that he would mourn there for his son.</p>

<p>"Southward!" shouted Ulric to the viking at the rudder
of the trireme. "We have done well this day, and the
night cometh."</p>

<p>A wind had arisen and the sails were full, but the men
did not seem to be idle. They busied themselves with
the tackle and with the stowing of the ship, but every
now and then each one would step out on deck or lean
over a bulwark to look long and earnestly across the
sparkling sea.</p>

<p>"This water is very blue," said Tostig the Red, "and
so is the sky. O Knud, thou hast put away thy bearskins."</p>

<p>"Aye," said Knud, "but how canst thou bear thy mail
in such a heat as this? I found this jacket of silk in the
after cabin. It is cool and it is fine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Red as blood it is," said Tostig, "but it would not keep
out an arrow. Thou dost never care much for armor."</p>

<p>"A shield is enough," replied Knud, "and I can catch
arrows on my seax. I would not be overweighted. I
trust the gods will soon send us another fight. I would
get hand to hand with some good fighter. There is more
pleasure in killing with steel than with the prow of a ship."</p>

<p>The jarl gave orders concerning many things, and then
he spoke to Lysias the Greek. The youth had seated
himself in a hollow place between two oar benches and
his face was in his hands, for he was weeping.</p>

<p>"Not often do men weep in the Northland," said Ulric,
sternly. "I have heard that the Greeks are brave. Why
mournest thou? Hast thou not had good vengeance upon
the Romans this day? Not one of them escaped. Thou
shouldst rather be rejoicing."</p>

<p>"Alas! Alas!" murmured the beautiful youth.
"Corinth! My Sapphira! I shall never see her again!"</p>

<p>"She was thy love?" said Ulric, softening somewhat.
"I never had a love save Hilda, the saga woman, and she
was a hundred years old. I loved her well. Where is
thy Sapphira?"</p>

<p>"She was more lovely than a dream!" said Lysias, looking
up through his tears. "Her father was Licander, the
astrologer, and she was like a star. He knew the heavens
and the stars in their courses, and he read their signs.
But he foretold to the Romans their Parthian defeat and
they slew him for his bad augury. Of his kindred they
left not one, and Sapphira they sold for a slave to Pontius
Pilatus, the procurator of Judea. I care not to live, for I
have been scourged and I have lost my love."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he threw off a light robe of linen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
which had covered him, and Ulric saw the half-healed,
festering lines of the Roman scourge all over the flesh of
Lysias.</p>

<p>"Thou mayest well weep for that!" exclaimed Ulric,
"if thou art the son of a free warrior."</p>

<p>"I did stab three in Spain," said Lysias, "and I had
plotted to sink the quinquereme, for she had a bad leak
which might be opened."</p>

<p>"Get thou up!" said Ulric. "I will gird thee with a
sword and give thee a shield and spear. When thy
scourgings are healed thou shalt have mail. Thou art
strong."</p>

<p>"I have won foot races," said Lysias, rising, "and I can
ride any wild horse. I am a bowman and I can cast the
javelin far and truly."</p>

<p>"Be more contented, then," said Ulric. "I will give
thee chances to strike Romans. There is no need for thee
to mourn."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest not love," said Lysias; "but I thank
thee, and I would have weapons."</p>

<p>"Come with me," said Ulric, and they went together to
the after cabin.</p>

<p>There were doors by which this might be closed, but
one of these was open and they went in. Then it could
be seen that this cabin space, which was large, was divided
into four apartments by strong wooden walls, each
having a door and a window, and in the windows were
small sheets of glass to let in light and keep out the sea.
This first room where they now were had been the place
prepared for some person of high rank to occupy, an officer
in command of the ship or a high passenger. It was
finished in carved wood, with hangings of silk and linen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of many colors and of fine needlework. Here, also, were
lamps that hung in cressets, and there were fixed tables
and soft couches and many fair weapons and pieces of
splendid armor. None of these had the jarl worn as yet
save a helmet and a rare coat of linked mail richly gilded.
Now he selected a good belt, with a sheath and sword,
and a long sheathed dagger.</p>

<p>"Throw off thy robe," he said to Lysias. "Put on this
tunic and the sandals. Belt thee with these."</p>

<p>So the youth did, and it could be seen that his shape
was not only comely, but molded for great vigor. The
muscles stood out upon his arms and shoulders and Ulric
himself was but a head the taller.</p>

<p>"These will soon heal," said Ulric, examining the lash
cuts. "Oil them well. I will aid thee. They are now
not deep. Thou art a good swimmer. I noted thee in
the water. Here are thy shield and spear."</p>

<p>"They are Greek, not Roman," said Lysias. "I am
glad of that. I want a bow and arrows."</p>

<p>"A quiver and a bow are here," said Ulric. "But the
arrows are long and so is the bow. See if thou canst
bend and string it."</p>

<p>"That can I?" exclaimed Lysias, seizing the bow. "It
is from Sparta, for only the Lacedemonians make them
of this length. The Parthian bows are shorter, for horsemen,
but only a Parthian can bend them&mdash;or such as I.
We are of the ancient Corinthian archers, and there were
none better on earth."</p>

<p>He was bending the strong wood as he talked, and
Ulric saw that he did so and put on the string of twisted
silk with ease. Then took he an arrow from the quiver
and drew it to the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou art the captain," he said. "Thy men call thee
the jarl and say thou art of the sons of their gods. Canst
thou send this arrow farther than I can?"</p>

<p>"I will handle thy bow," said Ulric.</p>

<p>He, too, unstrung and strung it and drew the arrow to
the head, but he said, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"Thou of the Greeks, I understand thy saying concerning
skill. I am many times stronger than thou art, and
yet I think thee the better bowman. I will call on thee if
I would have a sure arrow sent."</p>

<p>Lysias lifted the spear, which was a fathom long, and
light, but he looked around the room and found more of
the same pattern and made a bundle of them.</p>

<p>"They are well made," he said, "and their points are of
good steel. I once threw one like these through the heart
of a man from Athens. He was an enemy of my father.
I met him on the seashore and I was quicker than he in
casting. He should have worn a thicker breastplate.</p>

<p>"Hah!" laughed Ulric. "I am a spearman, but I prefer
the North spear and the pilum."</p>

<p>"I like them," said Lysias, "but I know one man that
can outthrow thee. He is a Roman knight named
Pontius, and they call him the spearman. He is the
procurator I told thee of. I would I might live until I
can kill him. He liveth now in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Thither go I!" exclaimed Ulric. "I have promised
Ben Ezra that I will take him to his own, and I must go
to that city and see the temple. I have it in mind that I
may see his god. They say he is a good god and a great
fighter like Thor."</p>

<p>"I have heard much of him," said Lysias, "but he is
more like Jupiter. If thou wilt land at the island Paphos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
I will show thee his statue and thou canst see what he is
like. We shall hear his voice thunder if I read this
weather rightly."</p>

<p>"Then he is Thor!" said Ulric, turning to the door.
"Come! I know not the weather signs of this sea."</p>

<p>Out they went and Lysias glanced around the sky. His
face was brighter now and he stepped firmly like a warrior.</p>

<p>"O jarl," he shouted, "I am a seaman also. Take
down thy sails quickly! Put out a bank of oars. Bid
thy steersman keep the head of thy keel southward, for
from thence cometh a tempest. The sky will darken
rapidly."</p>

<p>"The Greek is right!" shouted Sigurd. "I had forgotten
the sign of such a storm, but I call it to mind. It
is a strong one."</p>

<p>Down came the sails, out went the oars, and the thick
haze on the water southerly, which had been sunlit and
fair to look upon, shot up toward the middle heaven,
blackening as it went.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Wulf the Skater, "thank the gods! We
are to see a kind of storm that we do not have in our own
seas."</p>

<p>"Fine storms come to us in midsummer," said Ulric,
"and they roar well in the fiords. Will the anger of Thor
be louder here? The Greek saith that his Jupiter can
thunder, and the Jew told me that his Jehovah is also a
thunderer. Are they of kin? They who speak the same
tongue are of one house."</p>

<p>The Greek was now standing by the anvil and hammer
on the fore deck.</p>

<p>"The sign of this ship was Minerva," he muttered, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the Saxons have given it to Vulcan. If yonder cloud is
indeed of the wind from the African desert we may yet
wish that Neptune were our steersman. But what care
I for the gods? They were never yet of any use to me.
My father made many sacrifices, but the Romans slew
him."</p>

<p>There now were sails in sight, but these were fast furling.
Most of them were small, but one, at the greater
distance, had seemed much wider than the rest.</p>

<p>"I have been watching her," said Sigurd to Ulric,
speaking of this craft. "I am not young, but my eyes are
the eyes of a falcon. Now that her sail is down her oars
are out and she steereth toward us. The storm will give
her oarsmen enough to do."</p>

<p>"But we must watch her," said Ulric. "Even a merchantman
might seek our company, but she may be a warship."</p>

<p>"So may some of these lesser keels be of the pirates of
these coasts," said Sigurd. "They are many, and we do
well if we smite them, for often they are good captures."</p>

<p>"Here cometh the wind!" shouted Knud the Bear, exultingly.
"The foam flyeth!"</p>

<p>First came a sheeted flash of the blinding lightning, and
after that closely followed a deep-throated reverberant
peal of thunder.</p>

<p>"The voice of Jah!" muttered Ben Ezra. "He hath
spoken from his high place."</p>

<p>"Jupiter the Thunderer!" exclaimed Lysias, still standing
by the hammer of Thor as if for protection. "I fear
him only at such hours as this; but he is a god of the
Romans and I am a Greek. Evil are all gods or I should
not have lost my Sapphira. Evil are they and wicked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and they hate men, for they destroy us. There is no
man but must die, and if the gods were good, we might
live. But these Saxons are brave seamen!"</p>

<p>Little cared they for storms, these sons of the sea kings.
They shouted and they sang as if they were in a battle,
while the waves grew mad and boiled frothing around the
high wooden walls of <i>The Sword</i>. Her head was kept
toward the wind and she rode the billows like a vast
waterfowl, for the Roman shipbuilders were well skilled.</p>

<p>Less easy must have been the course of a keel that
strove to cross the surges with her side to the wind, and
it now could be seen that the large stranger was laboring
and that now and then waves broke over her.</p>

<p>"She bringeth small peril to us," said the jarl. "We
will row with but one bank of oars. Let their rowers
weary themselves with three. The trumpeter on her fore
deck soundeth a signal."</p>

<p>"Of what good," laughed Wulf the Skater, "is the
blowing of a horn in such a gale as this?"</p>

<p>"He sendeth us a signal to heave to and wait for them,"
said Sigurd. "What sayest thou concerning this fellow,
O Jew?"</p>

<p>"I think her one of the cruisers sent out by the proconsul
of Spain," replied Ben Ezra. "They are all weaker
vessels than this, but they are swift. They protect merchantmen
from the African pirates to rob all for the proconsul."</p>

<p>The air grew darker, denser, and the salt spray flew
into all faces, but the jarl stood upon the after deck and
blew upon his war horn a blast louder than that of the
Roman trumpet.</p>

<p>"Thy horn be exalted!" shouted Ben Ezra. "It is as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>the horn of a king! May Jehovah of Hosts be with thee,
thou mighty man of valor! Sound again! Let these
heathen know that we fear them not."</p>

<p>"But for the storm we might strike them," growled
Sigurd. "It is ill to let such a prey go by us."</p>

<p>Now was there also a change in the appearance of Ben
Ezra. He stood by the jarl as erect as a pine tree. From
the stores of <i>The Sword</i> he had provided himself with
arms and armor of the best, by permission of Ulric. The
visor of his brazen helmet was open and it might be seen
that his dark face glowed like youth as he gazed angrily
at the enemy.</p>

<p>"He is a warrior!" exclaimed Tostig the Red. "I like
him well. I think he might strike a good blow with that
long crooked sword which he hath found. I saw it, but
I preferred a straight blade. The shield lifteth lightly in
his hand and his mail coat fitteth him. He hath put
brazen guarders upon his arms and legs. A small man
should avoid such as he in the press of battle."</p>

<p>So said others of the vikings, but they were watching
more closely the Roman keel.</p>

<p>The trumpeter sounded several times and as often did
they send back defiances from their war horns.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Lysias, "this is the storm which cometh
from the African desert. It is not like any other. Not
only is there much thunder and terrible lightning and
strong wind, but I have felt sharp sand upon my face. It
will blow long and hard, and the waves will not go down,
but there will be no more rain. The sky is clearing."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest the storms of thine own sea," said
Knud the Bear; "but are we far from land?"</p>

<p>"No man knoweth that," said Lysias; "but here cometh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the Roman, like a fool. I would thy jarl might strike
him. O jarl, may I use the bow?"</p>

<p>"When thou canst," said Ulric, "but the distance is yet
too great."</p>

<p>Like fierce and angry music rang out the laugh of the
Greek, but his arrow was on the string and he raised the
bow.</p>

<p><i>The Sword</i> sank heavily into the trough of a sea wave
and the Roman keel was lifted high upon a surge, just as
a long, vivid sheet of lightning seemed to bring her nearer
by its brightness. Her steersman was a giant, unarmored,
straining hard at her tiller and bracing himself.
At him was Ulric looking when suddenly he threw up his
hands, letting the tiller go, and the feathered shaft of the
young Greek's long arrow quivered against his naked
bosom.</p>

<p>"Odin! Well shot!" shouted Ulric, but the bowstring
twanged again and another Roman fell upon the deck beside
the dead steersman.</p>

<p>Left to itself and to the will of the wind and the waves,
around swung the keel of the Romans, while a great surge
poured over her bulwarks and her rowers were hurled
from their seats. Wild was their shouting and another
surge poured in.</p>

<p>"Strike her not!" said Sigurd. "Be thou prudent with
thine own keel, lest thou shouldst be in some manner disabled.
Let the Greek send his arrows, but steer upon
thy course."</p>

<p>Ulric so ordered, but shaft after shaft did Lysias send,
not all of them hitting, but not all failing of a mark.
Other war horns than that of Ulric were sounding and
other bows were also quickly plying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think," said Tostig the Red, "that we have no better
bowman than this Greek. He will be a good help in a
sea fight. I like well to see his long arrows go so straight
to their places. Then the mark goeth down and it is time
to laugh."</p>

<p>The Roman rowers were toiling hard to recover control
of their vessel, but the Saxons knew little of the astonishment
and dismay that reigned on board of her. Her crew
had not thought of an open enemy at the first. They had
deemed <i>The Sword</i> a friend until the sounding of the
jarl's war horn. Even then they had expected no resistance,
at least no attack, until their steersman fell and a
man of rank near him was pierced by an arrow.</p>

<p>Better than a sailing vessel can a rowed keel turn her
head to the waves, however, and before long the Romans
were once more striving to overtake the Saxons.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Dead God in Africa.</small></span></h2>


<p>Clouds without rain swept fast across the sky and the
waves followed <i>The Sword</i> as if they willed to overwhelm
her. Well was it that her stern was so high and that she
was strongly builded. It had seemed, also, that no sea
harm had befallen her pursuer, but now the darkness
deepened and the watchers on <i>The Sword</i> could no longer
discern the Roman.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Sigurd, "it is a time for prudence. This
flying sand telleth of some shore, I think, at no great distance."</p>

<p>"It might be carried far by such a wind," said Ulric.
"But Ben Ezra told me of great cities in Africa which
have been buried by the sand blown from the inner
deserts."</p>

<p>"What further counsel hath he?" asked Sigurd.</p>

<p>"Answer him, thou," said the jarl to Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>"O warrior of the Saxons," said the Jew, "thou sayest
that thou hast sailed these seas aforetime. Thou mayest
know that the presence of one Roman trireme portendeth
the speedy gathering of a fleet. It were well to destroy
this one if she cometh near us again. But we have now
escaped her pursuing. Let her watchers not see this ship
again. I would advise that we now go eastward by the
stars, for we may note them at times through the rifts in
the clouds."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will so order," said the jarl. "I were not wise to
risk harming my own keel by a battle among these high
waves. It is a peril to a ship to be dashed against even
one heavy timber where the aim cannot be made certain.
Moreover, we have been long at sea and it were well to
seek a harbor."</p>

<p>Ben Ezra said no more, now that his counsel was approved.
The head of <i>The Sword</i> was turned eastward
and all the oars were plying. Neither was the wind now
so much against her, but the waves were still tumultuous.
Fast waned the night, growing darker as it passed, and
the jarl himself remained at the helm.</p>

<p>"I go onward into an unknown sea," he thought.
"Who may tell what may be before me? Dawn cometh.
There is gray light. O watcher!"</p>

<p>Answered him then not a Saxon, but the deep voice of
Ben Ezra from the foremast.</p>

<p>"O jarl! A fire! Hold! We near a land!"</p>

<p>"Cease rowing, all!" shouted Ulric. "O Jew, look
again. What seest thou?"</p>

<p>"Only a dim fire, far in the southward. It is a guide for
us, but we may seek it cautiously. The wind goeth down."</p>

<p>"It is so," said Knud the Bear. "It was a hot wind,
and this air is cooler. I thought we were sailing into a
furnace."</p>

<p>"The desert is like a furnace, I have heard," said
Sigurd. "Men burn up in it and all horses die; but lions
live there. How can any beast live in a land of fire?"</p>

<p>"I know not," said Ulric, "but yonder is a brighter
streak of dawn. We shall soon know if the Romans are
near us. We may slay them if the water becometh
smooth enough for a good fight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be a grief to all men," said Tostig the Red,
"if we lost an opportunity. But if this be land, I want
some beef."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed an old viking. "We had many
cattle on the Gaulish coast, but in Spain we got little but
sheep. Hereaway may be found cattle. We may throw
a net, and we may find fishes."</p>

<p>The jarl said nothing, for he watched the sea and the
sky and he steered the ship.</p>

<p>"Nearer!" shouted Ben Ezra from the mast. "And
the daylight cometh. I watch for the Romans. May the
curse of Jehovah be upon them and theirs forever!"</p>

<p>Lysias was on the fore deck, and as he heard Ben Ezra
he muttered angry words in his own tongue. Then he
whispered softly to himself, or to a shadow, and his fair
face grew white and his teeth ground together as if he
were in agony. So do they suffer who have lost a love
and know that it is forever gone, for Lysias had said:</p>

<p>"Worse far than if they had slain her! I would that
she were dead and I with her. But I may live to slay
Romans. Why did this Saxon jarl spare any of them?
But he is captain, and they say he is a wise one."</p>

<p>In the small wooden fort for slingers and archers, high
up the stout mast, sat Ben Ezra, and a viking sat with
him.</p>

<p>"O Saxon," said the Jew, "would thy jarl spare them
if they came with the day?"</p>

<p>"The son of Brander is jarl, not I," replied the viking,
surlily. "Speak thou not carelessly of the leader of men.
Thou art no seaman. He will strike when he is ready.
Let that content thee."</p>

<p>For deep and strong was the hold of Ulric upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
older men, by reason of his skill as a seaman and as a captain
and because of his good fortune; for they saw plainly
that Odin and Thor were with him and that the gods of
the Middle Sea could do nothing against him. Even the
ice gods had been his friends and the god of the Druids
had also helped him, sending him away from Britain unharmed.
It was a great thing to have such a jarl, of
Odin's line. They all knew, moreover, that Hilda, the
saga woman, must by this time have gone down to the
gods and that she willed exceedingly well to the crew of
<i>The Sword</i> and to her young hero.</p>

<p>"He is truly a leader of men," growled the Jew through
his thick beard, "but I would once more smite these Philistines
of Rome."</p>

<p>"In that I am with thee," said the viking, heartily.
"Thou art a good sword. I would see thee in battle. It
is pleasant to look upon a warrior that slayeth zealously.
But our feast of blood will come to us. Wait."</p>

<p>Up sprang the sun above the blue waves of the Middle
Sea, and all the Saxons shouted joyfully. It was true
that there were no enemies in sight, nor present hope of
any good fighting, but here was a land that they had
never seen before. All seamen know the joy there is in
finding a country that is unknown.</p>

<p>"Hael! O land of the South!" shouted Tostig the Red.
"Thou hast mountains as tall as are those of the North.
But this is a bay, a harbor, not a fiord."</p>

<p>"What sayest thou, Ben Ezra?" asked Ulric of the
watcher on the mast.</p>

<p>"Row in!" replied the Jew. "There is no other keel in
this haven and it is a good one. I see no sail nor any
boat seaward. This is Africa, and a city is on the shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
but the fire was at the head of the bay. There are rocks
ahead. Row around them."</p>

<p>"I see them; a great ledge," said Ulric. "Broken and
sharp-toothed are those rocks, and they would wreck any
keel that should strike upon them. It is a place of
wrecks."</p>

<p>The rowers rowed and <i>The Sword</i> went on through a
wide passage at the right of the ledge. Then she was in
a great basin where many keels might ride at anchor, and
before her and on either side of her lay the land.</p>

<p>There seemed but a gentle slope at the seashore. Beyond
might be a plain for a few miles, and then, lifting
their heads so high that they entered the dominions of
the upper gods to be capped with ice and snow, were the
many mountains. Into that upper land no man may
enter, for the ice gods will freeze him and bury him in
snow for his insolence.</p>

<p>It was all exceedingly beautiful, but the rowers now
rowed slowly and all the other Saxons watched warily as
<i>The Sword</i> drew nearer what seemed a landing place, a
structure of stonework builded far out into the harbor.</p>

<p>"Bring thy ship to yonder wharf," counseled Sigurd.
"No men are to be seen, but there are walls and temples
and houses. This may be a town of the magicians of
Africa. Beware of them, Ulric the Jarl."</p>

<p>"I would I knew who kindled the light," said Ulric,
thoughtfully. "If we had sailed toward it in the dark we
had perished on that ledge."</p>

<p>"Thereon are fragments of wrecks," said Sigurd.
"The breakers there are high."</p>

<p>So said other of the seamen, but <i>The Sword</i> was now
making fast to the stone jetty, and Ben Ezra was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>out upon it walking shoreward, with his scimiter drawn.
He seemed like a younger man. But he was not to go
alone, for closely behind him hurried Lysias with his bow,
and Knud the Bear.</p>

<p>"Here burned the fire," said Ulric, a few moments
later, pointing at a heap of ashes near the head of the
jetty. "There hath been much burning of wood at this
place."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he left it behind him and marched rapidly
forward. He left a strong guard with the ship, but he
thought it best to enter this strange town with tenscore
of armed Saxons arrayed as if they were to be assailed by
some enemy.</p>

<p>On went Ben Ezra, but he met no man, and he came to
a wall, in the face of which was a ruinous gap where once
had been a gate. From this opening it was seen that a
broad street led away, bordered by ruined palaces. At
its far end arose one of the temples which had been discerned
from the ship, as it stood upon high ground.</p>

<p>"Here," said Ben Ezra, "is a city which Jehovah hath
smitten for the sins of them which dwelt therein."</p>

<p>But he spoke loudly, in the old Hebrew tongue, and at
once a voice responded:</p>

<p>"Who art thou, O Jew, coming hither with a sword?
The sword hath departed from Israel, as it hath from
Tyre and Carthage. I am Annibaal, the foe of Rome
and of Greece, and I am dying of hunger. Come hither
to me."</p>

<p>As if without fear Ben Ezra walked toward the sound
of that voice not many paces. Then crawled out from
behind a fallen column a naked, sun-darkened, very hairy
shape of a vast man, larger than Sigurd, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Thorolf, but he lay prone upon the sand gasping. Only
one eye had he, for the other was but a hollow socket, and
he had but one hand and one foot and both of his ears
were gone. He was but a mutilated remnant of a strong
man, and his only weapon was a long straight sword,
very bright and seemingly keen, with a golden hilt,
whereon were glittering gems.</p>

<p>"O Annibaal," said Ben Ezra, in the tongue of Tyre,
"what is this city?"</p>

<p>"It is the city of the dead," said Annibaal. "I was a
chief of Carthage, whereof this was a colony, but some
came hither from Tyre, and here were already many from
Nubia and from Egypt. First the Greeks of Alexander
harmed us in the old time, but after them, in my day,
came the Romans. They smote us hip and thigh, slaying
whom they would slay, making slaves of many, and
of me, a prince and captain, they made what thou seest,
leaving me here alone."</p>

<p>Already Lysias and Knud stood by Ben Ezra, and behind
them a few paces halted Ulric the Jarl and his men.</p>

<p>"I wonder thou didst not die," said Ben Ezra, "or that
the lions took thee not. I see some of them even now."</p>

<p>"I have slain lions," said Annibaal, "but it is now as if
I were friends with them and they harm me not. It is
their city and we agree together. Yet I had at this time
no more food and I perish, but I lighted my death fire to
trap Roman ships to my ledge. I have slain many there,
and sometimes I have had joy to hear them when the wind
brought their cries to the shore. Their bodies float to
the strand and the beasts and the ravens feast upon the
wolves of Rome."</p>

<p>"He must die," muttered Knud. "He slayeth sailors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
It is not good to trap men, so that they die a cow's death.
It is wicked to rob a warrior of his right to die in fight or
by the righteous breaking up of his keel."</p>

<p>So said other of the vikings, thinking of Valhalla and
the gods, for they all were religious men, scorning an evil
action. But Ulric had sent in haste for food and for
water and for ale, commanding that this man should be
fed.</p>

<p>"Ye are too late," said Annibaal. "I pray thee, rather,
for thou art a prince, strike me with thy spear."</p>

<p>"That is a just thing, O jarl," said Sigurd. "He hath
been a warrior. Thou wouldst ask thy kinsman to make
the hero spearmark on thee if thou wert unluckily perishing
in thy bed. Send him marked to his gods, that they
take him not for a coward."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Ulric. "Ben Ezra, talk thou with him
as thou wouldst."</p>

<p>In Hebrew and in the tongue of Tyre did the twain
converse. When the water came, and the food and ale,
Annibaal drank a cup of water, but more he could not do,
for he was passing.</p>

<p>"I have learned much," said Ben Ezra; "but he dieth.
Refuse him not thy mercy, O jarl. He is a prince, and he
is worthy of thy hand. Take thou his own sword and
smite off his head lest thou fail of a friend in thine own
hour. Quick ere he fainteth!"</p>

<p>Ulric took the long, beautiful sword, which had slain
both men and lions, and he struck as became him, for he
heard murmurs among the Saxons.</p>

<p>Annibaal had feebly lifted his head to receive the gift
he had asked for, and it was severed well, falling upon the
sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well done, O jarl!" shouted Knud the Bear. "I
liked him not, but it were shame to let a brave warrior die
of thirst. Now do I not fear at all to go on into this
place, for we have put blood at the gate."</p>

<p>The other Saxons shouted their approval of their jarl's
kindness to Annibaal, and they marched forward willingly,
blowing their horns and clashing their spears upon
their shields, for all this great ruin was very wonderful.</p>

<p>The street was long, and as they went on Sigurd remarked
to the jarl:</p>

<p>"Where there are lions there are no cattle. Where the
Romans have been there is left no plunder worth taking.
We will but use our eyes till we tire and then we will lift
our sails and depart."</p>

<p>Ulric answered not, for a strange look was on his face
and his eyes were studying the sword of Annibaal.</p>

<p>"This hilt hath many runes," he said to Ben Ezra.
"Canst thou read them?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said the Jew, "but one thing the Carthaginian
told thee not. I had heard much of this city. It
was first builded by the kings of the forgotten ages,
whereof there are no writings. Our own writings tell us
somewhat of them. The Egyptian priests know more,
but tell it not. So did those of Babylon the elder. Here
was a great people, but they perished. Even their gods
died, being slain by the sword of Jehovah."</p>

<p>"As many gods have been slain by Thor and Odin," responded
Ulric. "I like your god, that destroyeth his
enemies."</p>

<p>More slowly they walked as they drew near the front
of the great temple.</p>

<p>"The stones of it are large," said Ulric to Ben Ezra.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>"They are greater than the Druid stones that I saw in
Britain."</p>

<p>"I will show thee greater stones than these in the temple
of Jehovah at Jerusalem," replied the Jew.</p>

<p>"I will go there with thee," replied Ulric. "But these
are wonderfully graven. Only a good chisel may cut
granite rock."</p>

<p>"Their tools were of bronze," said the Jew, "and none
but their priests knew how to make them. Taller pillars
are in Egypt than in Greece or Rome, but they are of the
old time. No more are set up since the Egyptian gods
departed. They, too, were overcome by Jehovah."</p>

<p>"He is a great god," said Ulric, reverently. "I would
be glad to see him. Let us go up these steps and look in."</p>

<p>Some of the vikings paused on the steps and would go
no further, for a chill was on them in spite of the sunshine.
One said to another: "The magicians may still
be here, or some of the old gods of this place."</p>

<p>"The son of Odin need not fear them," was answered;
"but we are not as he is. Let us wait until he hath gone
in."</p>

<p>Great was their faith in their jarl, but they were disappointed
that in this harbor they were to obtain no cattle
nor any plunder.</p>

<p>First went Lysias, as if he feared not at all; but he had
seen many temples, and this was one from which its gods
must have gone away, leaving it solitary. His bow was
in his hand, however, and suddenly he stood still, putting
a long arrow upon the string in haste.</p>

<p>"Strike him!" shouted Ulric. "He may escape if I try
to spear him."</p>

<p>"A splendid lion he is!" shouted Tostig the Red.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
"Thou canst not slay him with thy arrows! Let me go to
him!"</p>

<p>Even at that moment they had passed the portal, for
at the top of the flight of steps was a level place, stone-floored,
surrounded by these vast pillars whereof they had
been speaking. Across this level was the portal, but no
doors were in it to hinder. Beyond, as they now saw entering,
was an open space, a hundred cubits wide and
more in length, but it had no roofing. It seemed like a
place of assembly, and at its further end was a high dais,
whereon was an altar and behind the altar an image. But
on the altar couched this lion, tawny and large. His head
had been between his paws, but now he arose and sent
toward them a roar that was like half-smothered thunder.</p>

<p>The arrow sped and it smote him in the breast, entering
deeply.</p>

<p>"Odin! What a bound was that!" exclaimed Ulric,
and all the Saxons shouted for the pleasure of seeing the
stricken beast fly through the air toward them.</p>

<p>"He belongeth to the Greek," said Sigurd. "Spoil not
his sport. He shooteth well. He is a warrior's son."</p>

<p>It had been a disgrace to any viking to interfere, even if
the lion should slay the Greek, but Svip, the son of Leiknar
went forward wrongfully, lifting his spear. All
others did but stand where they were and they called out
angrily to Svip.</p>

<p>"He is but a Greek," said the son of Leiknar; but the
lion sprang again and he sprang far, with a short roar
which was fierce and guttural, taking Svip for his enemy.
Brave was the son of Leiknar, but he knew not aught of
lions. Upon him fell the mighty beast, beating down
the spear with a forepaw. Sharp were the long claws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and swift and terrible was the tearing. The shield was
no defense and the mail was rent as if it had been leather.
Torn into fragments was the strong viking ere he might
draw his seax, but the bow of Lysias twanged again and
his arrow sped well.</p>

<p>"The lion hath no mark but his," said Sigurd, the son
of Thorolf. "Back! This is his battle. Let him win it
or perish!"</p>

<p>This was a moment when men look, but do not breathe,
for the lion turned upon Lysias and the youth faced him
boldly, drawing his long arrow to the head.</p>

<p>"Well shot!" shouted Tostig. "O Greek, thou art a
good bowman, but he hath thee!"</p>

<p>The lion had gathered his strength to spring, but the
shaft had gone in too far. The roar choked in his
throat. His limbs refused to cast him. He rolled over,
snarling, and pawing at the pavement.</p>

<p>"I would thou wert a Roman!" said Lysias. "But
such as thou art have torn my kindred in the arena."</p>

<p>"Slain!" shouted Sigurd. "Thou hast done well, O
Greek!"</p>

<p>"Svip, the son of Leiknar, erred to his death," said the
jarl. "The fault was his own. But this lion was first
smitten upon the stone of sacrifice. What sayest thou,
O Jew; is there in this any offense to the god of this
place?"</p>

<p>"There is no god," responded Ben Ezra. "Here are
but idols, and upon their altars couch the beasts of the
field. We may go forward. Who needeth to fear gods
of stone, which are the work of men's hands and which
neither walk nor speak?"</p>

<p>"The lions have no god," said Lysias.</p>

<p>"I would not fear him greatly if they had," said an old
viking, "but if he were a man, with a sword in his hand,
then I would know what to do with him."</p>

<p>Some of the Saxons then declared that they knew what
to do with the skin of such a lion, and they remained to
take it off rather than go any nearer to the stone god behind
the place of sacrifice. Grand and huge was he, the
idol of this broken temple of old time. He was the head
of a man upon the body of a beast, carved out of more
stones than one, and he crouched there, looking at them
with a stern and terrible expression.</p>

<p>"I think," said Ben Ezra, "that he is one of the forgotten
gods of the Sidonians. They will not set him up
in Egypt, but he was like Jupiter."</p>

<p>"There is no hammer," said Sigurd. "It is not Thor.
See the jarl!"</p>

<p>They had paused, looking, but the son of Brander the
Brave had walked curiously to the side of the god and
was studying his marks, for there were many.</p>

<p>"I would," he muttered, "that Hilda were here, for I
think she would read. These are like the runes upon the
old Odin stone beyond the fiord, and they were made
when he came from the East. I think this to be one of
the Asas; but how came He to make this temple and place
it here? The gods do strangely at times."</p>

<p>By him now stood Lysias, and he said: "O jarl of the
Saxons, linger not. The Jew hath found a stone which
must be lifted. He waiteth for thee."</p>

<p>No message had Ben Ezra sent, but he was stooping
over a flat slab in the place of sacrifice. Upon it there
were marks of fire and the stone was crumbling.</p>

<p>"Why lift it?" asked Ulric, drawing nearer. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
have we to do with the secrets of the gods? Why should
we anger them?"</p>

<p>"They are dead," said Ben Ezra, "but I think this to be
a door of the priests. It is but a broken stone. Give me
thy spear."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Ulric, "I can pry with a spear shaft. We
will have it up if anything may be hidden here for us."</p>

<p>The fire-broken limestone yielded in several pieces to
the prying of the tough spear shafts. As its pieces were
lifted, or as they fell away, behold stone steps, from which
all shrank back save the Jew and the son of Odin and the
Greek. Even Sigurd held back a moment, saying:</p>

<p>"I like it not. It is the jarl's place. Let him venture
first. He knoweth runes that we know not. So doth the
Jew, but the Greek is a young fool."</p>

<p>Dangerous indeed it was for any man to step into a
chamber under the altar of a strange god, but when they
went down and entered it and looked around there was
but little to see.</p>

<p>"A store of broken weapons and rust-eaten armor,"
said Ulric. "Some of the hilts and shields are good
enough. But there are many skulls and bones."</p>

<p>"A crown!" shouted Ben Ezra, with a round thing in
his hand glittering. "Here placed they the ashes of
kings from the altar. I know not why they should have
buried with one the diadem of his realm. It may be that
his dynasty was ended. Many of these stones are rare
and precious. Here is gold, also, but the silver is of no
great value. Let us bear all to the ship, for the spoil of this
sacred tomb of the kings would buy a Roman province."</p>

<p>The vikings in the outer air were summoned, and now
they were not unwilling to venture, for the fear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
place had departed when they heard again the voice of the
jarl. Neither did they care overmuch to find merely the
remains of the dead, and they were greatly pleased with
the treasures.</p>

<p>Ben Ezra bore away one shield which was heavy with
gold, and in the middle of it was a jewel so like a great red
eye that the vikings said it was looking at them revengefully,
and they would not touch it.</p>

<p>"This place the Romans missed in their search," said
Ulric. "Little reverence have they for the altars of unknown
gods."</p>

<p>Even heavy were the burdens carried to the ship, and
now all who had been left to guard her were entitled to
take their turn in the exploration of the city. They went
and they came, but they found nothing to bring with them
and they slew no wild beasts. They reported, however,
that they had seen a leopard and a number of hideous
beasts which Ben Ezra told them were hyenas, which delighted
to feast upon the dead of battlefields. Successful
fishing had been done in the harbor with the small boats,
and there was enough for all, but that night there was
much murmuring over the lack of fresh meat.</p>

<p>"Besides," said some of the men, "this strange treasure
hath its value, but there hath been no good fighting.
When will this jarl of ours lead us to a throwing of
spears? The months of the summer are already wasted."</p>

<p>To these an answer was given by Sigurd, the son of
Thorolf, that to them was the fault, for by reason of their
unruliness had there been needless landings and delays on
the coasts of Gaul and of Spain, and idle cruising after
fishing boats and empty merchantmen which fought not
and paid but little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the jarl forbade us to slaughter their crews," said
one. "I would have slain all."</p>

<p>Men who will to find fault may readily prepare a cause.
Thus far the voyage of <i>The Sword</i> had been even too
prosperous, being guided by prudence, and there was
lacking the curbing which cometh from wholesome disaster.
The weather was all too warm for Northmen, and
some few of them had sickened, and of this sickness had
four vikings died a cow's death but for the mark of a
spear which was given them by the hands of friends.
Now, also, the skin of the lion aroused jealousy against
the Greek. It was declared that an hour must be found
for him to feel an edge of a seax, for he was not a Saxon
and there should be no outland men like him and Ben
Ezra upon a ship from the Northland. The jarl was too
hard in some matters and he was too soft in others.
Nevertheless, days went by while all looked at these temples
and houses and the mighty fortifications. As for the
jarl, he explored somewhat, but he abode mostly with the
ship. He was silent and moody, for there were many
things upon his mind.</p>

<p>"I have come far out into the world," he thought. "I
have seen that which is exceedingly marvelous. I have
looked, also, upon the face of a dead god. Now I will go
on until I may have speech with one that is living."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Murmuring of the Men.</small></span></h2>


<p>Out of the African harbor sailed <i>The Sword</i> with a
good wind, and there was no present need for rowing.
No longer were the Saxons willing to linger in that place
and live upon fishes. Small pleasure was to be had there,
they said, save to lie at night and listen to the cries of
many wild beasts. They had not hunted at night save
that one of the youths of Sigurd's party had ventured
beyond the jetty foolishly and had not returned. Blood
had been found in the morning, but not any of his bones.
It had been better if the weather had been rough or if the
men had been at the oars, for in their idleness upon this
blue and peaceful sea was an occasion for discontent.</p>

<p>"The jarl must do better than this!" they said to each
other, and as they talked of battles the thirst for blood
increased among them, for it is as a wild fever when it
cometh.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Sigurd, the son of Thorolf, not long
after <i>The Sword</i> passed beyond the ledge whereupon so
many had been wrecked by reason of the revenge fire of
Annibaal, "I think we do well if we steer now eastward.
We shall find too many Roman triremes in this neighborhood."</p>

<p>"I would seek them," said Ulric, "if not too many of
them were together. Dost thou know of a shore or an
island where there are cattle?"</p>

<p>"Verily I do," said Ben Ezra, "but I know not if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
may find it easily. We may but sail on. Lysias is with
the steersman now, and he is pointing."</p>

<p>Vebba, the son of Uric, was at the helm, and he hated
the Greek, but he listened, for he could not despise a good
bowman.</p>

<p>"I would carve the blood eagle on thy back," he
said, laughing, "but if thou wilt guide to where we
may slay somebody, thou art better worth killing. I hate
thee."</p>

<p>"So do I hate thee," said Lysias, boldly, "but we may
not fight on the ship. I will give thee thy sword play
when we get to a good place. But I shall strike thy head
from thy shoulders."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Vebba. "I like thee better. But bring
us first to some good fighting."</p>

<p>Then went Lysias to Ulric and the Jew, and they conferred
somewhat, but Lysias passed from them to the
after cabin, and came out bearing something that he took
with him to the after deck.</p>

<p>"I saw it there," said Ulric. "It is a harp, not half so
large as that of Oswald's. What can the Greek do
with it?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see," replied Ben Ezra. "Among the
Greeks are those who are skilled in music. Hearken!"</p>

<p>All ears upon <i>The Sword</i> were suddenly turned to listen,
for the harp was a good one.</p>

<p>"He playeth well!" said Sigurd. "No man shall slay
him. We needed harping."</p>

<p>"Aye," replied the discontented men, and then they
shouted to Lysias: "Sing!"</p>

<p>Not at once was he ready to sing, and the harp sounded
on as if he heard them not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sing! Sing!" they shouted again. "Sing, or we
will slay thee!"</p>

<p>"Slay on, cowards!" laughed Lysias, angrily. "What
care I for slaying!"</p>

<p>For he had been muttering hoarsely to himself something
about Sapphira and there were tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Down!" shouted Sigurd, to a viking who was drawing
his seax. "Harm him not, lest I send thee a spear!
I would hear his harp. Down, I say!"</p>

<p>The spear of Sigurd was a matter to be avoided, and
the seaman left his weapon sheathed and sat down. But
at that moment arose the voice of Lysias in a grand Greek
song, a song of war and of contending warriors.</p>

<p>"Right!" shouted the men to Sigurd. "Thou shalt slay
any that shall rob us of our harping. He singeth well."</p>

<p>None would have expected a voice so powerful and so
sweet, and they who heard it clapped their hands or
clashed their spears upon their shields.</p>

<p>Then the war song ended, and the harp began to send
out low, sweet music that made them think of the Northland.
They said to one another that now the trees
were in leaf, and the grass was green, and the wind was in
the pines, and the waves were on the shores, and the
voices of the gods could be heard in the fiords. The
women and the children, too, were in the houses, or they
were caring for the cattle, and the fisher boats were out
from all the villages. So they grew quiet and looked
across the blue waters of the Middle Sea less discontentedly,
and the thirst for blood waned away for the hour.
And yet they knew not that now the Greek was singing
in his own tongue of Sapphira the Beautiful, and that he
did not at all see the ship, or those who were in it, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
sea, but that his eyes, like those of the blind, were seeking
far away for a face and a form that were out of sight, beyond&mdash;he
knew not where.</p>

<p>His own countenance, with its perfect outlines and its
youthful color, exhibited his sadness in keeping with the
flowing music of his lyre, but he knew not that the eyes
of Ulric and of Ben Ezra were reading him. Unlike the
rest of the vikings, excepting Sigurd, they understood the
words of the song, which was from one of the old poets
of the better days of Greece.</p>

<p>"I have heard," whispered Ulric, "that even as he saith,
the young women of his people have great beauty."</p>

<p>"Yea," returned the Jew, "I have seen many of them. I
have seen this Sapphira, and she did excel. But no maidens
are as those of Israel and Judah, the roses of Sharon
and the lilies of the valley. Their voices are those of
birds and their forms are of the heaven. Such was the
mother of my son in her youth. Such were my daughters.
I am glad that they fell by the sword&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How were they not captured by the Romans?" asked
Ulric.</p>

<p>"Because of the swords of their husbands and their
brethren," said the Jew, calmly. "All died together, but
the fairest of them needed no sword save her own. She
chose to die by her own hand rather than to become the
sport of the heathen."</p>

<p>"She did well," muttered Ulric. "She was dark and
she was beautiful. She was brave and true. I have
never loved, but I would I could find one like her."</p>

<p>"If she were of the race of Abraham," replied Ben
Ezra, "she might not wed save with one of her own
people. That is our law concerning women."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a good law," said Ulric. "Hilda, the saga
woman, told me of it. She said that ye have good sagas
of your own and that your runes are ancient. Are there
any among you that are descended from the gods?"</p>

<p>"We have but one God," said Ben Ezra, "and all
we are his children, for he is the creator and father of
men."</p>

<p>"He is Odin, the all-father?" said the young jarl, inquiringly.
"Then, when I get to Asgard, I shall see him.
I have thought much concerning gods. That was a
strange one in the temple in the city of ruins. He gave
us much treasure."</p>

<p>"We took it," said Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>"Yea," replied Ulric, "we did so. But the Romans did
not find it, nor any others that came, until the god who
sat there watching permitted it to be taken. That was
but his stone face that we saw. Thou knowest not much
of gods, to think that he saw us not. Is thy god blind,
that thou canst hide away from him?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Ben Ezra, thoughtfully. "Talk no
more. The Greek hath ceased. I think thy men like him
better, but there is a spear waiting at any hour for either
him or me."</p>

<p>"So is mine waiting for him who may cast his own unduly,"
said Ulric, angrily, "and that know they well.
But the sun is sinking and a sail is in sight. Sigurd seeth
afar. He is coming."</p>

<p>"A small trireme," said Sigurd, as he drew near. "I
think we must take her."</p>

<p>"Take her," said the jarl. "Oars, all! Vebba, son of
Uric, steer for yonder keel!"</p>

<p>Loud rang the shouts of the Saxons and the discon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>tented
became good-humored, but there was little need for
fast rowing. The stranger was nearing them at its best
speed, and ere long they could hear the sound of a
trumpet.</p>

<p>"The grapplings!" commanded Ulric. "If we may not
strike her with the ship, we will board her!"</p>

<p>Swiftly the two keels approached each other, and rash
indeed were the Romans, for they were arrogant, not
knowing with what they had to deal. They saw the
Saxon flag on the mast. They heard the war horns.
Many men they saw not at the first, for concealment of
his strength was the prudence of the jarl, lest his enemy
might strive to escape. All the more freely did the fighting
men of the small trireme crowd her decks and gather
at her bulwarks.</p>

<p>Even from afar did the arrows of Lysias and Tostig
and other bowmen and the slingstones of Knud begin to
go in among them, angering them as some of them fell,
hurt or slain. They, too, had bowmen, but neither good
nor many, and their arrows were short.</p>

<p>Cunningly did Vebba veer away <i>The Sword</i> at the
nearing, that a flight of spears might hurtle among the
Roman soldiers, thinning them. Past them shot the
swift keel of the Saxons, only to turn again suddenly,
crashing back upon their further banks of oars. They,
too, had been ready for boarding, but their bulwarks were
not so high as were those of <i>The Sword</i>. Her grapnels
were well thrown, moreover, and the two ships were
as one when the legionaries made their brave rush to
climb on board their enemy. Well had it been for them if
they had been more in number. Well if they had not
been so rashly self-confident, and if they had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
half beaten by astonishment at the sudden appearing of
the Northmen at the ship's side.</p>

<p>With laughter and with mocking did the Saxons hurl
their spears and then follow with sword and ax. Over
the bulwarks they went, through the gaps left by slain
Romans, and quickly they went two for one, slaying joyously.
No Roman thought to surrender, nor was any
mercy in the hearts of the vikings, but among them all did
none smite more eagerly than did Ben Ezra and Lysias.</p>

<p>"Slay! Slay!" shouted the Jew. "O Greek, thou art
too slow. Hew down! Smite under the fifth rib! Let
none escape!"</p>

<p>"Good fighters are they!" shouted Vebba from the after
deck of <i>The Sword</i>. "I will have a fine contest when I
slay that Greek. I will fight him fairly. But I must get
the Jew before me to see how he will handle that crooked
blade. He cleft a Roman to the chin. Hah! I am but
steersman and I miss the killing."</p>

<p>So did others of the vikings, for there were not enough
on the trireme to put blood upon every good sword or
spear. They were all gone too soon, and there was disappointment.
Nevertheless, the legionaries had died
hard, and nine of the Northern heroes had gone to
Valhalla.</p>

<p>"To them the gods were kind," said Sigurd, "but this
trireme is a fair prize. There are ten head of small, fat
cattle, besides four fresh carcasses. We must have them
on board <i>The Sword</i>, with the other plunder, before we
kindle the fire."</p>

<p>The men were attending to that, for here was their
fresh meat without the trouble of landing to find it. All
of the slain might be burned with the trireme, with all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>honor, so there was no more care for that. Some Saxons
were wounded, but not so that they might die, and there
were no prisoners. All provisions and arms were taken
over speedily and the good spirits of the men were returning,
for none of them waited for needless cooking of the
beef that was ready. Roasting might be done afterward,
but the sharp knife could shred, and a viking cared for
little more at the end of a won battle.</p>

<p>"Fire, now," commanded Ulric, at the last. "Throw off
the grapplings and let her drift away. I would see her burn."</p>

<p>So the rowers pulled to a little distance and paused,
letting <i>The Sword</i> rock gently over the soft waves while
the fire blazed more and more brightly upon the decks
and in the waist of the Roman trireme.</p>

<p>"She burneth well," said Sigurd.</p>

<p>"So burn every Roman keel!" exclaimed Ben Ezra.
"Jehovah of Hosts hath been with me this day, and I
have gotten vengeance upon mine enemies. My sword
hath been deep in the hearts of the heathen."</p>

<p>Lysias was silent, but his fair face glistened with pleasure
as he gazed upon the mounting flames. His lyre was
now in his hand again and his fingers wandered over the
strings.</p>

<p>"The harp! the harp!" shouted some of the vikings.
"If he playeth not, we will slay him."</p>

<p>"An evil spirit is among them," muttered the Jew.
"Whence he cometh I know not. Who shall cast him out?
for we have neither scribe nor priest on this accursed vessel.
I think that he belongeth to the idol upon the fore
deck."</p>

<p>In that he spoke of the anvil and hammer of Thor, for
to him the Saxons ascribed the gift of this victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is a demon," said Ben Ezra, "and he hath entered
into these uncircumcised. I would he might lead them
to Gehenna."</p>

<p>"The harp! the harp!" again demanded the vikings,
and the voices of the rowers were joined to the shouts of
those who were feasting.</p>

<p>"The wind riseth well and so do yonder flames," said
Lysias; "but they who are dead feel no pain of burning.
Within me is a fire which is a continual torment. The
harp were a relief, and I will sing."</p>

<p>It seemed as if a strange spirit of wild song had come
upon him and his lyre. It mattered not greatly that few
of the vikings understood his words, so fierce and so triumphant
was the music of his singing. Moreover, they
looked upon his face and it gave them an interpretation,
for there was a terrible meaning in its expression.</p>

<p>Now the rowers ceased and the sail was up, but the
burning Roman ship also felt the fresh wind, and it was
as if it strove to keep them company while Lysias sang.</p>

<p>"She will founder shortly," said the jarl. "We are
leaving her. I would I knew more nearly whitherto we
have come. We are far in the Middle Sea and we should
be near some of its islands."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest," remarked Sigurd, the son of Thorolf,
"that opposite to the southerly point of Italy there lieth
a great island, whereon is a volcano, vomiting fire, for
under it is the world which burns, and there do the gods
war with one another. I think we are between that
island, which is called Sicily, and a part of Africa. O
Jew, what sayest thou? Thou hast visited many parts of
Africa."</p>

<p>"We have wandered here and there," said Ben Ezra.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
"The question is difficult. But if yonder haze telleth of
the coast of Sicily we may meet another trireme soon.
There are many hereabout. They will for the greater
part be merchantmen."</p>

<p>Down sank the vessel they had burned, with much loud
hissing of fire meeting water, and the clouds of smoke
and steam went up while the Saxons blew their war horns
and shouted their exultation. They all had feasted well,
however, and those who were not on watch were willing
to slumber while the increasing gale carried <i>The Sword</i>
swiftly toward the east.</p>

<p>Another was at the helm, and Ulric, the son of Brander,
went and sat down upon a silken-covered couch in the
after cabin. He was alone, and he brought out his jewels
to look at them. They were many and they were beautiful,
and he turned them over one by one.</p>

<p>"Never before," he said, "did I have so good a lamp as
this that hangeth here. The oil, too, is perfumed and the
room is full of a sweet odor. These are the ways of the
Roman captains and rich men. I may not see Rome, for
there are too many quinqueremes in the way, too many
legions of warriors on the land. We are few. I do not care
much for their gods, for I have beaten them. I will go
on to Asgard, but I will go first to this temple in Jerusalem.
Ben Ezra saith that I can buy both priests and
governors with these bright stones. But I may have to
slay my own men if they obey not. If I cut down a few
of them the rest will be more peaceable. These Saxons
that came with Sigurd hardly call me their jarl. If they
were dead it would not matter. I will go my own way."</p>

<p>The ruby was now in his hand, the great red stone that
was graven with the name of the Hebrew god, and among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
them all there was no other like this. It glowed like fire
in the lamplight, and Ulric said: "It is full of blood. It
is a stone of stones. But whence came the blood, and
how is it full of fire? Is he angry with me? I think I
will carry his gem to him in his temple, and I will tell him
I have brought it back. I would not keep from any god
that which is his."</p>

<p>So he put it back into the casket and took out an emerald.
This, too, was graven with deeply cut runes.</p>

<p>"One of them," said Ulric, "is like the runes that Hilda
showed me in the sand by the sea, but it is alone. I care
not until there are three. It is green and wonderful. O
Hilda of the hundred years, would that I could show to
thee this jewel of the old gods!"</p>

<p>The lamp burned low and it was flickering. Without
the gale roared loudly and the waves beat against the
sides of the ship with a groaning sound. There was no
voice but of the wind and of the surges. The curtains in
the cabin swayed to and fro, as did the cresset of the lamp.</p>

<p>"Hilda! Hilda!" murmured Ulric, but he saw her not,
and even his thought of her was confused in his mind.
The saga woman was tall and dark, but not so tall and
fairer was this thought which came before his eyes as if
he were in a dream:</p>

<p>"So beautiful! So beautiful!" he said. "Her eyes
are like stars and her hair is a cloud of shining curls.
Her lips are like the ruby of the temple. I think she is
one of the Hebrew maidens that Ben Ezra saith excel all
others. I will go to that land and find her, for it must be
that she also is of the daughters of the gods. And now I
can see Hilda, and her hair is white, but her eyes are shut.
Therefore I know that they have carried her to the tomb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
that was made in the rock of Odin. I shall see her no
more until I get to Asgard. If this is her hand upon my
head, she should speak, for I love her well."</p>

<p>He listened, and the lamp went out, but no voice came;
and he lay down upon his couch, but a fire was kindling
in his heart.</p>

<p>"Lysias loveth Sapphira," he thought, "but thus did I
never feel before. The Hebrew maiden! I would Ben
Ezra had not told me of her, for now I can have no other.
I had thought that my love would be blue-eyed and a
daughter of Odin. Shall I not be content if I find that
she is dark, and that she is a daughter of this Jehovah,
the god of the Jews? I will go on and I will see what she
will say to me."</p>

<p>Then he slept, and <i>The Sword</i> swept onward swiftly
toward the sunrise.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Evil Spirit on "The Sword."</small></span></h2>


<p>Through one day more the western gale blew furiously
and <i>The Sword</i> was driven before it, for none on board
cared for any better steering. Many vessels were seen
from time to time, but all were too busy caring for themselves
to pay overmuch attention to a trireme that might
be fighting the storm as they were. The vikings were at
ease concerning the weather, but they grumbled much that
the tossing and pitching of their ship prevented them
from making fires wherewith to roast their beef or to broil
their fish. On board their Roman keel they had found
gratings of iron for cooking, better than any of their North
making. These gratings were wide, upheld by iron feet,
and under them were slabs of stone to receive ashes and
cinders. Fire would remain upon them well in any ordinary
weather, but in such as this the brands and coals
might be cast hither and thither. It was not even a time
for the telling of sagas nor for the lyre of Lysias, and
again the men grew moody and sullen.</p>

<p>The night returned, and Ulric kept the helm through
all its watches, for a heavy weight was on his mind and
he had heard from Ben Ezra concerning the evil spirit.
"I would I could slay a demon," he had answered, "but of
what good is a spear for an enemy thou canst not see?
It were almost as if one fought with a god. I have
thought I would like to fight with one, but not with Thor
or Odin nor with thy Jehovah."</p>

<p>"They who contend with him are broken," replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Jew, "but I tell thee we are far on our way. I think we
are not far from Cyprus. We might safely land in one
of the havens of that island."</p>

<p>"We might meet a Roman fleet," said Ulric.</p>

<p>"They have none in these waters," said Ben Ezra.
"Their merchant ships of any consequence go and come
in squadrons, well protected, and they have driven out all
pirates. They will not be watching, I think, for the
coming of such as thou art."</p>

<p>"We now are late in the season," replied Ulric. "I
had thought to have reached this water before any other
keel from the North. We know not what may have
called upon the Romans for watching. I am thinking
that when this wind abateth I must find the men somewhat
to occupy them."</p>

<p>"An evil spirit is a busy one," said Ben Ezra. "All
thine would find enough to do in Cyprus."</p>

<p>Afterward many of the men came to the jarl with questionings,
and also to the Jew and to Lysias. These were
looked upon with more favor for the time, for it was said
that they might have some worth for piloting.</p>

<p>A night and a day and a night went by and now the
waters were again quieted. They were even too still, for
the rowers had to be sent to the oars, and the sun looked
down upon them with fervent heat, making their toil
burdensome. Once more the ship was floating upon an
even keel and the men speedily bethought them of the
fire gratings. Twain of the fat cattle were butchered,
and the jarl thought well of it, that the men might be kept
in good humor. The fires were lighted, and casks of ale
were opened, but the evil spirit was, nevertheless, making
himself busy among the hearts of the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>In the trireme <i>The Sword</i> itself, when she was captured,
there had been a few skins of wine, but it had been
red and sour and the vikings liked it not. Such as it was
it had long since been consumed. In the spoil of the
burned trireme, however, and hardly noticed at the first,
there had been found many wine skins. All had been
taken with care, and now one of them was opened to find
out what it might be.</p>

<p>"Dark and sweet and good!" exclaimed Vebba, the son
of Uric. "I will bear a horn of it to the jarl."</p>

<p>Large was the drinking horn, and he filled it to the
brim. Sparkles arose upon the surface of the wine, and
it seemed to laugh, as if the evil spirit which lived in it
were accomplishing his purpose.</p>

<p>"It is strong," said Ben Ezra. "Drink it not, O jarl,
for the demon of wine is thine enemy."</p>

<p>But he was too late, for the son of Brander drained the
drinking horn as if it had held naught but ale. He felt
it from his head to his feet, as if it had been poured upon
a fire that was burning within him, and he stood erect,
straightening himself and clinching his hands.</p>

<p>"Bring me another horn of it," he said.</p>

<p>"That thou shalt not do," commanded Ben Ezra, sternly.
"Thou art the captain. I bid thee drink no more, lest
thou lose thy life and thy vessel. The demon is upon thee,
O jarl! Resist him, or he will bind thee hand and foot."</p>

<p>Then remembered Ulric a saying of his father and of
Hilda, and it was as if he had heard her voice saying:
"Son of Odin, beware of the dark wine of the south lands,
for in it is death."</p>

<p>"Bring me no more," he said to Vebba, "and let the
wine skins be cast into the sea."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>But the demon had been very busy and from lip to lip
had already passed the goblets and the drinking horns.
They had been emptied only to be quickly filled again, and
now the Saxons of Sigurd shouted:</p>

<p>"Haha! O jarl! Thou wouldst rob us of our feast?
We will show thee a thing."</p>

<p>Sigurd himself went among them, but to him, also, they
paid no heed, and he came back again.</p>

<p>"I am sleepy," said Ulric. "Wulf the Skater, these
three nights I have wakened. I will lie down for a while.
Take the helm."</p>

<p>Then came Tostig the Red and Knud the Bear and four
other Saxons of the house of Brander, and they sat down
by Ulric, spear in hand, with their axes lying by them.
Lysias brought his bow and Ben Ezra closed the visor of
his brazen helmet.</p>

<p>"Trouble cometh," he said. "The heathen are full of
wine and of the thirst of blood."</p>

<p>There was no quarrel between twain of the vikings that
were stepping forth upon the fore deck, but they were
berserkers, and their seaxes were in their hands, for they
were to fight without mail or shields.</p>

<p>Skin after skin of that dark, strong wine was opening,
and the men loved it, but they would see blood, they said,
and the two berserkers shouted as they fought.</p>

<p>"Both of them are down!" exclaimed Lysias. "Two
more take their places. O that the jarl were awake!
But I cannot rouse him. Were the Romans to come, we
were all dead men."</p>

<p>Furious was now the drinking, and a man cast a spear
at another without cause, laughing to see him struggle
and bleed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"The evil spirit hath entered them all!" groaned Ben
Ezra. "This is that which I feared greatly. Every
man's sword is against his neighbor."</p>

<p>Terrible was that fighting, for warriors who had lost all
skill of warding blows or parrying spear casts were still
strong to throw or to strike.</p>

<p>"Where is now this jarl of ours?" yelled a drunken
viking. "We will see if he be a son of Odin. We will
slay him and then we may sail at our pleasure. He hath
ruled us with too hard a hand."</p>

<p>Steady and stern had indeed been the rule of the son
of Brander, and he had brooked no gainsaying, but he had
been a prudent captain from the first, and there were a
full third of the men now to stand by him in his peril.
Would there had been more, for on both sides the slain
were many. Moreover, when a man went down that was
quickly his end, on whichever side he fought, for an
enemy came to thrust him.</p>

<p>"Wake, son of Brander! Wake!" shouted Tostig in
the ear of Ulric. "Call thou upon Odin, thy father, and
draw thy sword."</p>

<p>Waiting for no orders from any man, Lysias was sending
his arrows, sure and deep striking, calling out:</p>

<p>"With me be thou, O Apollo, god of the bow! With
me, O Mars, god of battles!"</p>

<p>But Ulric opened his eyes slowly and breathed hard.
Then he sat up and he saw the men fighting and the blood
flowing.</p>

<p>"Odin!" he roared, in a voice they had not heard before;
but the weapon he lifted was his pole ax, and he
rushed forward to the front of his friends.</p>

<p>"I go with him," said Ben Ezra. "It may be his god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
hath come to help him. Be with me, O Jehovah of
strength!"</p>

<p>"We will guard thee at the helm," said Knud and Tostig
to Wulf the Skater. "This will be ended speedily.
Look at the jarl!"</p>

<p>"He, too, hath a demon!" burst from the lips of Ben
Ezra, as he saw Ulric striking. "They go down before
him like corn before the reaper."</p>

<p>Sigurd had been smitten to the deck by his own Saxons,
and Ulric stood over him with his ax until the son of
Thorolf was hidden by corpses of the slain.</p>

<p>Mad with wine and with the fever of the thirst of blood,
the rebellious vikings fought on, nor would they yield to
the command of the son of Brander.</p>

<p>"We will die!" they said. "But we will first slay thee.
It is a feast of swords."</p>

<p>"I would I could spare enough for rowers," said Ben
Ezra, "but their blood is on their own heads. The evil
spirit destroyeth them."</p>

<p>"Thus endeth the cruise of <i>The Sword</i>!" said Ulric,
sadly, when at last he might pause for breath. "Save
thee, O Ben Ezra, and Lysias, and these few faithful,
there are none living save some for whom the valkyrias
are calling. What shall we do? for thou art old. What
shall be the end of these things?"</p>

<p>But Tostig and Knud had watched the falling of
Sigurd and they were lifting from him the corpses.</p>

<p>"The sail is up," said Ben Ezra. "Steer eastward, for
we may not do aught else now than land in Syria. Thou
and thine shall see Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"So be it!" said Ulric. "I think we are none of us
wounded. I am not."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>"Glad am I of that!" exclaimed Lysias. "I feared for
thee in that combat. But thou art of the heroes and Jove
was thy keeper, with Mars and Apollo."</p>

<p>"A feast of blood!" exclaimed Tostig as he lifted the
body of Vebba, the son of Uric, from Sigurd, the son of
Thorolf. "The sea king is not dead. He was but
stunned."</p>

<p>Slowly arose the old warrior until he sat erect and
looked around him.</p>

<p>"I saw them!" he said, huskily. "I saw the Nornir in
the air above the sail. I saw the valkyrias, but they
looked sternly at me and passed by. Why, I know
not, for I fought well. Odin hath taken many this day.
O jarl, what doest thou?"</p>

<p>"Eastward!" said Ulric. "Canst thou stand upon thy
feet?"</p>

<p>Tostig and Knud aided him, and they brought him a
goblet of ale, for wine he would not drink.</p>

<p>"It is well with me now," he said. "My helmet is
cloven, but my skull is safe. The ax of Vebba was heavy,
but he will strike no more. Sad is it that he and these are
slain. Better had they fallen in a fight with the Romans."</p>

<p>"Not so," said Ben Ezra, "for if some of them were
living all we were dead. Let us cast them into the sea."</p>

<p>Wulf the Skater had watched the clouds, and now he said:</p>

<p>"Ulric the Jarl, if thou wilt, they should be over the
sides speedily, for a wind cometh. We shall use no oars
henceforth."</p>

<p>Sad work it was to cast so many forms of dead heroes
into the sea, but so had it been foredoomed by the Nornir,
and there were some of the wounded who died while the
task went on.</p>

<p>Then Ulric sat down by the hammer of Thor and
bowed his head, for his heart was heavy.</p>

<p>"I can sing no song," he thought, "over such a fight as
this. I think it will now be long before I see the fiords
and the hillsides of the Northland. My fate hath
changed for me in an hour, and I know not what cometh.
O Hilda, was this thy dark saying, that I understood not?"</p>

<p>No voice responded, nor any motion of the air, but he
looked upward and he saw birds that were flying eastward.</p>

<p>"So will I go," he muttered, "and they who are with
me. There is too much blood upon this keel. I would
she were burned with fire, for I hate her. The gods of
the Romans have had their revenge upon me. I will
never again speak lightly of any gods, for they have ways
of their own and they are cunning. Who shall protect
himself against an enemy whom he cannot see?"</p>

<p>Well blew the wind, and there was little now to be done
save to steer and to rest. All ate and drank, and Ben
Ezra seemed to love that dark, strong wine, but he used it
sparingly.</p>

<p>"It is made in my own land," he said, "but this came
from a Greek island, I think. There is good wine in
Canaan. I would eat again of the grapes and the pomegranates
of Israel and Judah. O my son! That he
might have been with me! O my Rachel and my daughters
and my firstborn and his brethren! The curse of
Jehovah be upon Rome forever! Amen!"</p>

<p>So the old Hebrew warrior wailed in the bitterness of
his soul, and <i>The Sword</i> sprang on over the billows, bearing
him to his own land, but she was now no longer a
warship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will not count the days," said Ulric to Lysias.
"We will speak to none that we may pass."</p>

<p>"Pause not!" replied Lysias. "Thou hast thy life yet
and I have mine. I have it in my mind that I shall see
my Sapphira. I have had a dream in the night and she
stood and beckoned me."</p>

<p>Ulric answered not, but that night he slept upon the
deck dreaming, and in the morning he thought about his
dream also.</p>

<p>"Hilda was there," he said, standing at the helm looking
across the sea. "Behind her was the sun rising. Between
her and the sun were many warriors, heroes of the
gods, armed for battle. There was blood on some of
them. But at the right hand of Hilda stood that dark
and beautiful one, and there were flowers in her hair, and
the flowers were both red and white."</p>

<p>Days come and go and no man may hinder them. The
vikings went to and fro about <i>The Sword</i> and she seemed
lonesome to them, for they were few and she was a great
vessel. From time to time many sails were seen near and
far, but none gave chase to <i>The Sword</i>. Even pirates
and all merchantmen avoid what seemeth to be a warship.</p>

<p>"Winds have been both good and bad for us," said the
jarl to Ben Ezra at the close of a day. "What thought is
in thy mind as to our nearness to any land?"</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Ben Ezra, thoughtfully, "by the stars
that I have watched; by the sun and winds; by the islands
which we have passed; by a dim understanding which
cometh to a man in such a case; by all the signs which are
given me, we are so near to our destination that we may
find a shore this night."</p>

<p>"And if a shore," said Ulric, "what shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Even the land that was given to the children of Israel
by Jehovah, their god," said the Jew. "It is ours yet,
but the Romans have taken the kingdom from us."</p>

<p>"Their gods are very strong," said Ulric, "and they
are exceedingly cunning. Else had Thor and Odin saved
to us the swords that sailed with us from the Northland.
Thy god refused to fight with the gods of the Romans. I
think he was wise in that. But he agreed with them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
they should not harm his temple, and I will go and see it.
I may meet him."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not see him," said Ben Ezra. "He was
seen by Moses, our prophet, but to all others he hath hidden
his face."</p>

<p>"I know not that," said Ulric. "They who see the gods
are forbidden to tell. Hilda, the saga woman, loved me,
but she would tell me naught concerning the dead save
that they have a country of their own. There is much
good in that country and when I am slain I shall go to it."</p>

<p>"Thou art to die by the sword?" asked Ben Ezra.
"How knowest thou that?"</p>

<p>"I am of Odin," said Ulric, "and a cow's death is not
for me. There will be blood in the hour of my going.
If thou seest me on a bed, be thou a Saxon unto me, and
smite me through with a spear."</p>

<p>"So said Saul, our king, to his armor-bearer at the end
of a lost battle," said Ben Ezra, marveling somewhat. "I
will do as thou sayest; for verily thou art a jarl and of
the princes of the North. Never before saw I a man like
unto thee for battle."</p>

<p>"Save Sigurd, the son of Thorolf, the sea king," said
Ulric, "I have met none that might stand before me. He
too, is of one line of the hero Asas, but not of Odin."</p>

<p>Ben Ezra was silent, thinking of these things, and <i>The
Sword</i> drove onward. He and Ulric were at the prow
as the darkness deepened. They could see no more save
the stars above and the glancing waves around the ship,
but they could hear the music of the lyre of Lysias on the
after deck. Knud the Bear was at the helm, and all that
remained of the crew were gathered there. They cared
not to sleep in the cabins or in the bunks, for some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
them said that the dead came at night to look again at the
keel from which they had departed and that the evil spirit
came also.</p>

<p>"I saw him not," said Wulf the Skater, "but Vebba,
the son of Ulric, spoke to me, and I think he said the
Nornir were at hand. So sayeth Sigurd, the son of
Thorolf."</p>

<p>Greatly dispirited were they all, and the lyre was a
comfort, but the song of Lysias was low-voiced and sad
and they could not understand the words.</p>

<p>Now from the fore deck came back to them one who
had heard from the jarl that they were to look out for a
land and be ready to lower the sail.</p>

<p>"Good!" shouted Tostig the Red. "O Sigurd, go to
the jarl and ask if we are steering rightly."</p>

<p>"That are we," said Sigurd. "Seest thou not the north
star? Go we not eastward? What need to trouble the
jarl? I would that they who are dead had obeyed him.
Then had we all been more joyful."</p>

<p>"Never had crew such adventures as we are having,"
said Knud. "I think we may gain some good fighting before
long. My hand goeth often to the hilt of my seax
and my blood is unquiet."</p>

<p>"A good sign!" exclaimed Wulf the Skater. "I feel
better for hearing thee. O Greek, sing us a war song!"</p>

<p>Loudly answered the smitten lyre for a moment, and
Lysias obeyed, but quickly came back from the fore deck
the command of Ulric, the son of Brander.</p>

<p>"Silence, all!" he shouted. "There is a trumpet, far
away southerly. We are too few and we near the land.
Hark to the breakers!"</p>

<p>Listening diligently, all ears heard the dashing of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
water as if upon rocks, and yet again came up from the
southward that distant peal of the trumpet.</p>

<p>"Struck!" suddenly exclaimed Sigurd. "We go upon
a shore. Is this thy land, O Jew?"</p>

<p>Not with a great shock, but glidingly and grating hard,
did <i>The Sword</i> go on a little while the sail was lowering.
Then she stood fast, and all on board of her knew that the
end of her voyage had come.</p>

<p>Needing no command, the Saxon sailors made ready
two of the small boats and prepared to lower them.</p>

<p>"The trumpet is nearer," said Ben Ezra. "But this
ledge of rocks cannot be far from the mainland. Thy
men seem to know not of fear and they obey thee."</p>

<p>"No Roman arms or armor," shouted Ulric. "We
land as Saxons and we will leave behind us no token.
Kindle a fire amidships."</p>

<p>To his cabin went he and Ben Ezra, and unto them
shortly went Lysias, but each prepared bundles of his
own to carry to the boats.</p>

<p>"No man knoweth of thy treasure nor of mine," said
Ben Ezra to Ulric. "Let the Greek, too, have gold and
silver coins, for he will need them. He hath fought
well."</p>

<p>In like manner was every man furnished speedily and
the burdens were not made uselessly heavy. Nevertheless,
Ben Ezra said to Ulric:</p>

<p>"Never before landed boats of thy people bearing to
any shore such treasures as are these. We may buy any
Roman governor if in so doing we do not hire him to put
us to the sword. We will say that we were wrecked, but
we must not be seen on the coast."</p>

<p>Now the boats were lowered and all entered them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
in every quarter of <i>The Sword</i> was a hot fire kindled.
The Roman trumpet had not sounded again when the
Saxons rowed away into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Row harder!" commanded Ulric. "The light of the
fire increaseth. We know not how near may be an
enemy."</p>

<p>Well had he spoken, for the flames were rising furiously
and the light wind fanned them well.</p>

<p>"A shore!" said Sigurd. "A sandy beach!" But all
others were looking back at <i>The Sword</i>, to see how fast
she was burning, and at that moment there swept past her,
outside, as if nearing to grapple her, a vast shape of a
warship. Then arose suddenly a great volume of shouts
in the Latin tongue, and the notes of a trumpet sounding
commands, but Ulric said in a low voice to his comrades:</p>

<p>"A quinquereme! And she also is upon the ledge of
rocks. What shall save her from destruction by that
fire?"</p>

<p>"She cannot escape," said Wulf the Skater. "It is as
if we had set a good trap. I think the fire hath already
caught her sail. There will many Romans perish this
night."</p>

<p>"Pull!" commanded Ulric. "The beach! We are
here. Haul up the boats. Out with all cargo and leave
them. Hark to the shouts of them who burn!"</p>

<p>Rashly in swift haste had the Roman warship dashed
forward to discover what might be this unusual thing,
of a light that grew and of a crew that replied not to a
trumpet of hailing. Not of any rocky ledge had her
steersman or her sailing master been thinking, and her
centurion had deemed it his duty to grapple and to board
this strange burning trireme. He would yet have passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
her once, only studying her case, but his own ship had
smitten a sunken rock, which forced her to swerve aside
heavily, plunging her alongside of her fiery destroyer.</p>

<p>In vain were then all struggles to release the quinquereme.
In vain was any effort to extinguish the swiftly
devouring flames. Even of small boats the Roman ship
had but four, and there were sailors who secretly, quickly
lowered these, dropping into them to row away at once.
Of these hurrying runaways there were none but hired
Ionian rowers, and they cared for their lives only.</p>

<p>Ill fared it for legionaries in heavy armor, for if they
sprang overboard, it was to sink. Sad was the fate of
many who went into the water, crowding and clinging,
for they perished grappling each other in their astonishment
and despair. The Roman warship was on fire from
end to end, and the side which was not yet burning was
toward the sea. What wonder that all discipline failed
and that all thought of obedience was gone? for every
bond is loosed by fire.</p>

<p>"If any follow, they must not find us on the beach,"
said Ben Ezra to Ulric. "I can see that the land riseth
high and that there are great rocks. Let us depart!"</p>

<p>"Odin!" responded the jarl. "<i>The Sword</i> hath once
more smitten the Romans. Every man take up his burden.
Follow me!"</p>

<p>"A good captain," muttered Ben Ezra. "I will cleave
unto him. But verily our lives are worth but little. I
would that we were among the mountains, even in Gilboa
or in Lebanon, or in the wilderness of Judea."</p>

<p>"Guide thou after daylight cometh," said Ulric. "I
would find crags and trees."</p>

<p>On went they, climbing a steep, and ever and anon they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
looked behind to watch the awful splendor of the burning
of the two ships upon the ledge.</p>

<p>"Here may we halt," said Ulric at last. "We are on a
height. It is a forest beyond us. The fire burneth
lower. There will be no pursuit."</p>

<p>There they sat down, therefore, wearied with their burdens,
putting these aside, and ere long they slept, every
man, without fear.</p>

<p>At the ledge of rocks in the sea there was silence, for
the two ships burned to the water's edge and there was
little left of them. Nevertheless, of the swimmers there
were a number who reached the shore, but all were of
sailors unarmored, and no officer or legionary was among
them. Here at the beach they found the two small boats
left by the Saxons, with oars in them, but the four boats
of the quinquereme, with the Ionian rowers, had landed
further on. There was little to be done by these exhausted
swimmers but to lie down and rest, and the
Ionians were likewise waiting for day, being full of fear
over what they had been guilty of in taking away the
boats of their ship. Only the sword could await them if
they were found by a Roman patrol of the coast, for they
were to be accounted deserters from their assigned
posts.</p>

<p>Not long was the remainder of the night. The morn
came, and when the sun arose Ulric, the son of Brander,
sat upon a rock, under an oak tree, looking out upon the
blue waters of the Middle Sea. Beside him sat Sigurd,
the son of Thorolf, and scattered around upon the grass
were the other Saxons. Lysias stood and leaned against
the rock, but Ben Ezra was nowhere to be seen. In the
hand of Ulric was the long, straight sword that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
found with Annibaal at the ruined city on the African
shore, but it was sheathed, and the jewels of its golden hilt
were glittering.</p>

<p>"There are men upon the shore by our boats," said
Sigurd. "They are escaped from the burning vessel."</p>

<p>"Look southward!" replied Ulric. "A squadron of
Roman cavalry. Let us see what they will do, but let us
step back behind trees out of their sight. They are too
many for us."</p>

<p>"Worse than that," said Lysias. "Horsemen might
carry an alarm and legionaries on foot might hunt us in
these forests."</p>

<p>The cavalry rode fast, and the men at the beach looked
mournfully into each other's faces, for there was no fleeing
from riders. Quickly came these and their officer
sprang to the ground, speaking loudly.</p>

<p>The light of the burning ships had been seen from afar,
and even now a swift galley had arrived, rowing around
the rocks of the ledge, while they who were on board of
her studied well the charred fragments.</p>

<p>The officer questioned with care the rowers, and a small
boat from the galley came to the shore with another
officer.</p>

<p>"Were there other boats than these?" he asked, pointing
at the twain left there by the Saxons. "These are
from a warship."</p>

<p>"Yea," said the centurion of the cavalry, "and these
deserters took away all chance for the escape of our comrades."</p>

<p>"We all swam ashore," they said, "and we found these
boats here. Other men than we made off with them,
We are innocent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>The two centurions looked at each other and they were
of one accord in this matter. At a word of command
soldiers dropped from their horses sword in hand. At
another word the work of punishment began and the stern
justice of the Roman military law was done in utter
injustice, for not one of these who were slain had sinned.</p>

<p>"They had done somewhat in other days," said Ulric,
"and the vengeance of their gods found them here, bringing
upon them a sword. No man escapeth the gods.
But I see another man down the beach. He is fleeing as
if for his life. I think, therefore, that these were not all
who came to the shore in some manner."</p>

<p>Great was the wrath and the dismay of all those
Romans at this terrible affair of wreck and fire, but there
was no sign to suggest to them the presence of Saxons on
the sea or on the land.</p>

<p>Unto the four boatloads of Ionian rowers at their
landing place, where they still lingered, came running the
one of their number who had gone forth as a scout. Pallid
with fear and horror he gasped out to them the thing that
he had seen, and he fell to the sand breathless with
running.</p>

<p>"To the mountains!" they shouted. "We are slain if
we are found on the coast. They now know not that we
are here."</p>

<p>Then it could be seen that not only had they taken
plenty of weapons even in their hasty flight from the
burning ship, but that their apparel was decent. Also
their talk indicated that they had many coins of money,
and that they knew this country whereupon they had
landed. They stood still for a moment, and they swore to
one another by their gods that this should forever be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
secret, and then they marched away up the steep and were
hidden in the forest.</p>

<p>Neither had they failed, in their talk upon the shore,
to wonder much concerning the first burning vessel which
had been the cause of their own disaster. They knew not
of the Saxon boats, but they had said of themselves that
they would not willingly fall in with any who had escaped
lest their peril might be increased.</p>

<p>"It were death," they said, "and we must at once put
any such men to the sword."</p>

<p>The Saxon men, whom they did not know, but of
whom they had been speaking, were gathered together on
the mountain.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Tostig the Red, "well that thou didst
order us to bring provisions, also, for our first needs.
Shall we not now go on into the forest and find a place
where we may kindle a fire?"</p>

<p>"O Tostig," said the jarl, "Ben Ezra is our guide.
This is his country. What sayest thou, O Jew?"</p>

<p>"Only this," replied Ben Ezra; "that we are upon
Mount Carmel, and that the forests thereof are deep. We
are safe if we are prudent. It is a wilderness into which
not many come at any time, but there are villages and
cities not far away."</p>

<p>"Lead on thou, then," said Ulric. "Let every man
bring all his burden. We will keep up strong hearts, and
we will see to what this strange coming on shore will
take us."</p>

<p>They had need of cheerful words from their jarl, for
upon them all was a shadow deeper than any of the
shadows of the forest. Their faces were dark, but among
them all was there no face like that of Lysias, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Greek. There was no light in it, but rather a bitter
sullenness.</p>

<p>"Sapphira! Sapphira!" he muttered, walking apart
from the rest. "Am I indeed nearing thee? Am I to
find thee? Am I, then, to love thee again or am I to slay
thee? Thou shalt not live to be the bondslave of a
Roman, even though he be a prince and a ruler!"</p>

<p>Ulric the Jarl heard him. It was as if he had been
spoken to concerning the Hebrew maiden whom he had
seen with Hilda.</p>

<p>"I think that she is somewhere in this land to which I
have been guided," he thought. "I will go on and I may
find her. This forest is a dense cover of this mountain.
I shall be glad to look upon that which is beyond it."</p>

<p>Ben Ezra led onward rapidly, but the way by which he
went grew steeper. They came out at last, much heated
by their heavy burdens, upon a level place, where were
no trees, and here he halted.</p>

<p>"Here let the fire be made," he said to the jarl. "But if
thou and Sigurd will walk with me a little distance further
ye will see something."</p>

<p>Gladly did the wearied Saxons pause and make their
camp, but their jarl and Sigurd followed the Jew. Not
far did these go until they came out upon a bold, high
promontory of rocks.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Ben Ezra. "The Middle Sea."</p>

<p>There were no trees to hinder sight and the air was
pure, so that they saw afar. There were many sails and
there were also galleys which might be warships.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Ben Ezra, "thou art escaped from a
Roman fleet. Thou wouldst not have done so but for
the ledge of rocks and the fire which destroyed thy vessel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Thou art on the front of Carmel. Now turn thee to thy
left. What seest thou?"</p>

<p>"A heap of stones," said Ulric. "They have been
shapely, but now they are broken down. Was it one of
the altars of thy god?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Ben Ezra, "but our fathers made that
heap for a sign of remembrance. In the ancient days
there was on that spot an altar to Jehovah. Upon it the
prophet Elijah sacrificed oxen and the fire of our god
came down and consumed both the sacrifice and the altar.
Here was Jehovah's victory over Baal, the god of the
heathen, and here were all the priests and prophets of
Baal slain with the sword."</p>

<p>"If thy god is here," said Ulric, "I am willing to remain,
for I think he hath befriended us. But I have no
quarrel with Baal or with any other god. I think Odin
and Thor to be at peace with thy Jehovah, but I like not
at all the cunning gods of the Romans."</p>

<p>"Jehovah destroyeth them in the day of his appointing,"
said Ben Ezra. "They cannot stand against him.
He is mighty."</p>

<p>The jarl was silent, gazing out upon the sea, and
Sigurd looked around him among the trees.</p>

<p>"O jarl," he said, "I like not this mountain, full of
gods. The men have kindled fires. Let us eat and drink
and then let us depart."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>Carmel and Esdraelon.</small></span></h2>


<p>"Here are boats!" exclaimed the Roman officer, as he
drew rein at the place upon the beach from which the
Ionian rowers had fled. "Then there were more of these
cowardly deserters. If all these boats had remained with
the ships, how many brave men might have been rescued!
We will search the mountains for these rascals. If Cæsar
hath been robbed of two warships by the fire and the
rocks, we will at least avenge the shades of our comrades
who were left to perish."</p>

<p>An angry man was he, and with good cause so far as
these men were concerned, and their crime was well deserving
of punishment. He rode away with his horsemen,
but there would soon be terrible hunters for blood
among the crags of Carmel. There would, however, be
a delay of hours before forces could set out from the war
garrisons, and meanwhile the Ionians had been pushing
their way into the forest.</p>

<p>They were of one accord that it would not be well for
them to continue long in one body, attracting attention,
and each man was in dread of all his companions, fearing
lest their very number should betray him to the sword.
They found what seemed a sufficiently hidden camping
place and they slept. At their breaking of their fast next
morning, having but little to break it with, they were apparently
almost cheerful, chatting lightly among themselves
concerning their escape. In that country, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
said, were great numbers of Greeks, who came and went
unquestioned by the authorities. A few more, if scattered
here and there, would go unnoted. Not long time need
pass before all of them might be upon the sea again and
far away, sailing from the many ports of Syria. Not
many of them seemed to be warlike men, but it might be
understood, in various forms of speech, that among them
was no man who grieved for the destruction of Roman
keels and Roman soldiers. Rather did some of them
mutter that with their will whole legions had perished
instead of half a cohort. They believed themselves to
be altogether unobserved, but upon them were now gazing
eyes of intense hatred from the leafy ambush of some
dense thicket at a short distance.</p>

<p>"O ye who hear me," said one of the deserters, loudly,
"know ye this! From the first ship that struck the reef
and began to burn did some surely get to the land. Like
us they are now in Carmel. What shall we do with
them?"</p>

<p>"Slay them!" sharply responded several voices. "Lest
they prove our ruin. Slay them without mercy!"</p>

<p>One of them was a tall, gray-haired man, with eyes that
were set near together and with a pointed nose. His
forehead was high and on it was an iron cap. He said:</p>

<p>"If they be too many, make friends with them at the
first, but let none escape. I will attend to that."</p>

<p>They listened as if he might be a man of rank and a
leader among them, but hidden by the bushes were ears
that understood the tongue in which he and they were
speaking, and there were other ears which did not
interpret.</p>

<p>"It is of no use to question this Greek of ours, O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Knud," whispered one to another of two strong men in
the ambush, but his own face and his manner asked a
question.</p>

<p>"Be thou silent, Tostig the Red," replied Knud.
"Watch him. Do as he doeth!"</p>

<p>For Lysias was muttering low in Greek, "He betrayed
my father in Corinth. He would surely destroy me. He
is a liar and he must die."</p>

<p>To the head he drew his long arrow, and his companions
hindered him not, for his face was burning with
wrath, and it pleased them to see him raise his bow.</p>

<p>"He is a young warrior," they thought. "He knoweth
what these have spoken."</p>

<p>Truly sped the arrow, and the tall old Corinthian
traitor was smitten through the face, so that he spoke no
more. Up sprang his companions, wild with fear, but
another and another of them went down before they
could escape among the trees, for the spears of Tostig and
Knud followed the arrows of Lysias and they three followed
closely, sword in hand.</p>

<p>"I think," said Knud the Bear when he and his friends
returned from a brief chasing, "that too many escaped.
I have counted but eleven slain. I will ask the Greek his
reasons for this when we reach an interpreter."</p>

<p>"Take all coin from these who are slain," said Lysias,
but he made his words plain by action.</p>

<p>"They are Greek and Roman coins," said Knud. "We
may need them. I am learning much concerning coins.
Oswald, the harper, hath many, but I cared not for them.
A sword is better than money."</p>

<p>"Not in a place of buying," laughed Tostig, "and we
are not now an army. We must pay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not a thief," said Knud. "I will pay, but I shall
surely be cheated."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Tostig. "So do we need to take
more coins. The Greek is right."</p>

<p>Then they returned to their camp and Lysias stood before
Ulric speaking. The jarl listened with care and he
became very thoughtful, for Lysias told him all the words
of the Ionians.</p>

<p>"So, we are to have foot soldiers hunting in these
forests," he said. "I had thought of that. Thou didst
well to slay them. But we who are Saxons may not disperse.
Go thou and seek thine own safety. Go thou,
also, Ben Ezra. Thou art among thine own people."</p>

<p>"Not so," said Ben Ezra. "Let Lysias go, but I remain
with thee for a season. Thou needest a guide. It
were well for thee and thy men to cross the plains of
Esdraelon and get into the mountains of Gilboa. We
will go by night, for there is no safety for us in Carmel."</p>

<p>To all the Saxons Ulric interpreted the words of the
Jew, and they said to him:</p>

<p>"Thou art the jarl; we will follow thee. But should
we not first slay this Lysias?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Ulric. "He hath fought for us this
day."</p>

<p>"Not so!" shouted also Knud the Bear. "He is a good
archer. I will cut off the hand that is laid upon him."</p>

<p>"So will I," said Tostig, and his seax was in his hand
quickly.</p>

<p>There the matter ended, but Ben Ezra talked with
Ulric apart.</p>

<p>"I send Lysias to Jerusalem," he said. "With him I
send a jewel to the chief priest and another to the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of the temple. We will pass over to Gilboa. Thence we
will go over the Jordan, at the middle ford. Afterward
we will go down to the wilderness of Judea. In that
hiding place no search can find us, as I have often told
thee, and it is near Jerusalem on the east."</p>

<p>"We are a score of men without Lysias," said Ulric.
"Shall we march now?"</p>

<p>"Come thou first with me," said Ben Ezra. "Not with
so much treasure may we cross to Gilboa lest we lose it
all on the way. I have found a cave in Carmel. Here
will we leave the precious stones save a few. I swear to
thee by my god that I will keep faith with thee."</p>

<p>"I swear not," said Ulric, "for I know not of an oath
with a true companion. Faith of a son of Odin cannot
be broken. It is a tryst of blood between me and thee."</p>

<p>"Better than any oath," said Ben Ezra. "Knowest
thou not, O heathen jarl, that thou hast covenanted in the
name of thy god, whom thou callest thy father?"</p>

<p>"Odin!" exclaimed Ulric. "So it is. He would be
angry with me forever if I failed thee in this matter. It
is well to beware of provoking the gods. See to it that
thou anger not thine own."</p>

<p>They walked away together, none following. Not far
to go was it before the Jew stood still and looked around
him.</p>

<p>"It is well if we are unseen," he said, "for I have great
doubts in my mind."</p>

<p>"I see here a great cleft in the face of this crag," said
Ulric. "Like this are many entrances of caves in the
Northland. I found some among the faces of the fiords.
In them are great bones of men and beasts and store of
old-time weapons that are made of stone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou wilt find bones here," said the Jew, "but I think
not many weapons. The cave is dark, and we will have
torches."</p>

<p>Exceedingly skillful was he in the kindling of a flame
among dry mosses, and Ulric found withered branches
of pine full of resin. A torch for each was lighted, and
they went in at the cleft, going cautiously.</p>

<p>"In such places as these dwelt the ancient prophets of
Jehovah," said Ben Ezra, "but now the caves of the land
of Israel are the strongholds of all robbers. I have heard
that there are robbers dwelling in Carmel. Turn, now.
Let us be sure that no enemy followed us."</p>

<p>The turning was quickly made, for they at that moment
heard a sound behind them. Then followed an angry cry
and a javelin sped over the head of the stooping Jew to
glance from the shield of Ulric. He spoke not, but he
threw his spear and drew his seax, for in the cleft passage
were armed men. True was the spear-cast and the javelin
thrower fell, but over his body sprang Ben Ezra. It was
then but a brief struggle between him in his perfect mail
and a robber whose garb was but a tunic.</p>

<p>"These were but fools," said the Jew as his scimiter
fell upon a fourth of these half-armed men. "I think
they are robbers and that they are Samaritans. Accursed
are they! I will look to know if there are more of them
outside."</p>

<p>He was gone but a moment, and when he returned he
exclaimed, hastily:</p>

<p>"Not any, O jarl! We will leave these bodies here for
a token. Now we may enter the cave."</p>

<p>"Touch them not," said Ulric. "Thou art wise. I
think that any comrade of theirs who may come to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
will believe this to be the work of the officers of the
law."</p>

<p>"In that were better security for aught that we may
will to hide," said Ben Ezra. "Seest thou now, O jarl?
This cave is deep. We will go in further."</p>

<p>"There are bones to build heaps with," replied the jarl.
"Here hath been a massacre, but these are dry and the
slaying was long ago."</p>

<p>Gloomy and terrible was that deep cave in Carmel, with
its dark shadows and its whitening skeletons. Among its
corners the Jew was searching, holding forward his torch.</p>

<p>"A soft spot in the floor here," he said. "We will dig
with our knives. We may come to it again by sure
marks, for behind it is the solid rock and at its right a
fathom and a half is yonder broken altar."</p>

<p>"Knowest thou," asked Ulric, "to what god belongeth
this altar? Was it thine?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Jew, "he hath no altars in the caves,
but only in the temple at Jerusalem. In the old time was
Carmel a stronghold of the Philistines. There have been
many gods among these mountains. They were all
destroyed by Jehovah."</p>

<p>"I would, then, that he might have a care for these
treasures of ours," said Ulric, digging rapidly with his
broad dagger. "Go deeper into the earth. Make it
wider. Now it is enough. O Jew, if thou and I are
slain, no other hand will ever take out that which we will
shortly put in."</p>

<p>The casket and some other matters brought by them
were now placed in the cavity which the jarl had dug, and
the covering was done with care and a removing of surface
traces. Then Ulric turned to look upon the altar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are deeply cut runes upon it," he said. "Canst
thou read them?"</p>

<p>"Nay, but I know that they are Chaldee," said the Jew.
"This altar is exceedingly old. Who shall say what men
and what gods have been dwellers in this cave!"</p>

<p>"We may now do no more," said the jarl. "We will
return to the men. It is a good prudence, every way, that
we leave a mark of blood at the entrance."</p>

<p>"Even so!" exclaimed Ben Ezra. "They were robbers,
but also are the Samaritans the enemies of my people.
Now am I sure that Jehovah is with thee, and I remember
that which is written of such as thou art, that he maketh
the heathen his sword."</p>

<p>Ulric was thinking of another matter.</p>

<p>"The burdens of the men will still be heavy," he said,
"but not now will they carry any weight of provisions.
We will obtain pack beasts when we may. And now we
have need for haste lest evil come upon us."</p>

<p>They went out of the cave together and returned to the
camp, but Sigurd met them.</p>

<p>"O jarl," he exclaimed. "Lysias hath disappeared and
the men are angry. We had thought he would for a
while go with us."</p>

<p>"We will guard our own heads, O Sigurd, the son of
Thorolf," replied Ulric. "We are better without the
Greek. He hath gone on an errand. We will but eat
and then we will depart, for the Romans come quickly.
The Jew hath a guiding for us."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Saxons all were angry, and they ate
in silence. Their jarl was too soft with strangers, they
said to each other. He avoided too much the shedding of
dangerous blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>He himself was stern and moody, for he was thinking
of his lost ship and of the Northland and of Hilda.</p>

<p>"If she knoweth where I am," he thought, "surely she
would give me a token. I doubt if she can follow me unto
this place. How could she find me in Carmel?"</p>

<p>He stood erect soon, and there was a strong impulse
upon him, for he lifted his war horn and blew three blasts,
toward the sea, and toward the forest, and toward the
great crag that standeth on the promontory of the mountain.
The sea replied not, nor did the forest, but from
the great wall of rock there came back an answer such as
will come in the winter time from out the deep throats of
the fiords when the gods are conversing. Once and
again it spoke, and Knud the Bear exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Odin is here, or Thor, for that is a war horn of the
North answering thine, O son of Brander. It is a good
omen. I like to feel that the old gods are with us."</p>

<p>"We will follow thee!" added Wulf the Skater. "Go
where thou wilt. I will not again forget that thou art of
Odin."</p>

<p>So Ulric took up his spear and shield and Ben Ezra
led the way; but the forest was dense before them and it
was a long walk eastward before they came out into an
open place.</p>

<p>From every lip burst a sudden shout as the Saxons
halted to gaze upon that which was before them.</p>

<p>"The valley of the gods!" said Ulric.</p>

<p>"The valley of the slain!" responded Ben Ezra. "The
plain of Esdraelon. The valley which is before Jezreel.
The valley of Decision. O jarl of the Saxons, it is the
place of the meeting of the hosts of kings. Since the
world was made here hath been the place of battles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Thereon have fallen more dead than on any other piece of
ground. The chariots and the horsemen have there gone
down together."</p>

<p>"Here, then, have Thor and Odin contended with the
other gods," responded Ulric. "Thy god hath been
here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And all the gods of Africa and all the gods of the
East!" shouted the Jew, enthusiastically. "Here the
hosts of Joshua contended with the hosts of Canaan.
Here have Judah, and Israel, and Egypt, and Babylon,
and Nineveh, and Persia, and Greece, and Assyria drawn
the sword. In the last days here in Armageddon will
perish Gog and Magog, going down before the spear of
Jehovah."</p>

<p>"Glad am I to have seen the place," said Ulric, and
every viking shouted for joy that he had looked upon the
greatest battlefield of the broad world.</p>

<p>Well was it worth coming so far to see, and gladly
would they have gone into one of those great combats of
the kings; but now they were led on rapidly, for the day
was passing. Not long did it take them to walk down to
the level plain, but all the while their eyes were busy.</p>

<p>Cities they saw and villages, and many scattered abodes
of men. The fields were long since reaped, but here had
grown much wheat. There were many vineyards, with
groves of olive trees and other fruit trees. Rivers not
large but shining. Small hills whereon were towers, as
if for watchmen and for garrisons. Names were given
to some villages by Ben Ezra, but the greatest town of all
was dimly seen, far away across the plain, and he said it
was the ancient city of Jezreel. Beyond all, toward the
east, arose mountains in long ridges, and they knew from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
him that these were the Gilboa to which he was leading
them.</p>

<p>"O Jew," said Ulric, "where halt we this night?"</p>

<p>"Not on all the plain," said Ben Ezra. "Even now we
near the great highway from the south and in it walks a
multitude, but I see no armed men. I think that many
eyes are already aware of our coming."</p>

<p>That might well be, for the sunlight flashed upon their
armor and their helmets and their spear points, but Tostig
answered:</p>

<p>"O jarl, what care we for armed men? I think the
Jew is right. We must hasten, even if we have to slay a
few Romans."</p>

<p>"None are here," said Ben Ezra. "And the people
will trouble us not. Pontius the Spearman, the procurator
of Judea, hath many gladiators and he hath mercenaries
whose speech is strange to the nation. None
will question you because ye are not legionaries."</p>

<p>"Well for them that they do not," growled Knud the
Bear. "I am no hired gladiator. I am a free Saxon.
What sayest thou, O jarl?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Ulric, striding forward. "Let us see
what this crowd meaneth."</p>

<p>"We have naught to do with them," said Sigurd, "but
I am curious to have a look at the people of the land.
None of them can say to himself that we came out of the
sea on the other side of Carmel."</p>

<p>Every Saxon was as Sigurd in willing to see the people
and to know what this might mean, for there were very
many in the highway, men and women and children, and
there were no horsemen, nor did there seem to be so much
as a spear or a shield among them.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Rabbi from Nazareth.</small></span></h2>


<p>Lysias, the Greek, stood in a copse of thick bushes near
the forest border and looked out upon the plain, but not
toward Gilboa. He had been digging in the earth, as
Ulric and Ben Ezra had digged in the cave, but he had
not been hiding treasure. He had but wrapped his
weapons and his armor in a woolen robe-cloth that he
might conceal such perilous evidence from inquiring officials
of Rome or of any local authority. Earth and flat
stones and sods were over them now, and he had made
marks upon trees whereby he might find that place again
if he should at any future day will to do so. He now
walked out beyond the bushes with no trace upon him that
he had been a warrior.</p>

<p>"Well was it for me," he said, "that I found such
goodly raiment among the spoils of the trireme. Fewer
questions are asked of him who is handsomely appareled.
Soon I will procure me a beast and I will go with all speed
to Jerusalem. It is a city to which strangers come from
all the world, and he who escapeth into a multitude hideth
himself in a solitude."</p>

<p>The tunic which he wore was of silk and his robe was
of embroidered linen. Sandals were on his feet and his
white turban was of a costly silken fabric. If he had retained
any weapon, it was now perfectly concealed. To
the eye of one who might chance to meet him he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
suggest beauty and riches and peace, and not at all an
archer whose bow had sent many messengers of death.</p>

<p>"Now must I be careful concerning robbers," he
thought. "I have both gold and jewels with me. But to
all who ask my errand I shall be but a scholar in the school
of Gamaliel at Jerusalem, and therefore I may not enter
Samaria, but must pass on swiftly. The Romans themselves
favor all such scholars, and I shall have their protection.
Their laws are good and my time for smiting
them again hath not come. But never will I show mercy
to a Roman."</p>

<p>Other things he said concerning the much-vaunted laws
and justice of the world's conquerors. Beyond a doubt
they not only claimed much in the way of righteousness,
and also did many things righteously, but behind this
sternly formal justice of theirs, and but little concealed,
was a man holding out his hand for bribes, and near him
was a place of scourging and the sword of a ready
executioner.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lysias walked on joyously. Soon he was
in a highway, and by it passed through hamlets. He
looked inquiringly at all places as he went, but he paused
not for conversation with any whom he met or greeted.
At last he came to the open gate of a wall, behind which
were a goodly house and some outbuildings of stone. In
the gateway stood an old man, well appareled, and before
him Lysias stood making reverent obeisance, as to an
elder.</p>

<p>"I am Simon Ben Assur," said the old man. "Who art
thou, O Greek?"</p>

<p>"I am Lysias, the scholar, of the school of Gamaliel at
Jerusalem," he replied. "I have lost my beast, for he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
worthless and he would go no further. Hast thou a good
ass for sale, that will travel swiftly?"</p>

<p>"I see that some one hath sent thee to me," replied Ben
Assur. "Thou knowest, therefore, that the beast is a
swift one."</p>

<p>"Well with thee," said Lysias. "I would buy him but
for thy extortionate price. Wilt thou now give me an
honest bidding, that I may pay thee and take him away?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Ben Assur. "They told thee my price?
There is more which they did not tell thee. The ass is
young and there is none swifter than he. He is well
trained. The saddle and the bridle are to be purchased
with him, as thou needest."</p>

<p>"One needeth them to ride withal," said Lysias. "But
every beast hath faults and thine is not worth, upon the
market, the half of thy asking. I will but look at him
and pass on about my business."</p>

<p>Loudly laughed Simon then, looking keenly into the
handsome face of the Greek. He turned and spoke to
some one within the inclosure, bidding him bring the ass.</p>

<p>"O youth," he said, "I mind not that thou hast spoken
with that evil beast of a Samaritan. Arcas offereth that
he will pay me for the ass next Passover week; and I rejected
him not, but told him that the price must now be
paid to me in five golden pieces. I will say to thee that
the pay days of Arcas never come, and wise men deal not
at all with him unless he giveth double security."</p>

<p>"I deal not with him," said Lysias, "but I will see thy
beast."</p>

<p>And now a serving man led forth to the gate a large
and well-shaped animal, upon which were a fair saddle
and bridle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mount and try him," said Simon. "If thou canst
ride at all, thou wilt ascertain what is under thee; but an
unskillful rider may wisely choose another, for he is full
of life."</p>

<p>Lysias sprang to the saddle and rode back and forth
along the highway.</p>

<p>"He must be mine at any price," he thought, "for in his
legs is my safety."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou take thy good bargain, O Greek?" shouted
Ben Assur as Lysias returned.</p>

<p>"He is no good bargain at five pieces," said Lysias.
"No ass is worth so much. I will give thee one piece&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou art no Samaritan," interrupted the old Jew.
"Thou art not Arcas, to buy of me and afterward to rob
me of my pay with false witnesses before the magistrate's
seat, proving that thou hast already paid me. Hast thou
not two pieces in thy hand? I will give thee a writing of
sale lest he be taken from thee in Samaria."</p>

<p>"Two I will give," said Lysias, after again galloping
up and down the road. "Make out thy bill of sale to
Lysias, the scholar. I now return speedily to Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"I think well of thee!" exclaimed Simon; afterward
adding, "I pray thee take my greeting to the great Rabbi
Gamaliel. He knoweth me. I deal fairly with thee. I
am not ashamed to have thee show unto even him this thy
purchase."</p>

<p>Back into the house he went and he soon returned with
a small square parchment of a bill of sale. But the coins
which he received were heavy coins of Athens and he
weighed them thoughtfully in his hand.</p>

<p>"Good youth," he said, "take thou now the counsel of
thy elder. Carry not too many of such as these with thee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Open not thy purse before strangers. Thou art overwell
appareled. Get thee as far as the gate of a walled town
having a garrison before the sun goeth down. Ride fast
and far that thou mayest be beyond any who might inquire
of thee concerning that which is now under thee.
Thou hadst better not enter Samaria."</p>

<p>"Fare thee well," said Lysias, urging the ass promptly.
"I take thy counsel."</p>

<p>"Well for him if he so doeth," muttered Ben Assur in
the gateway, "since Arcas claimeth the beast as already
his own. I will myself now depart for Damascus and
the Samaritan devil may seek for his five pieces where he
will. I have beaten him."</p>

<p>The thought then in the mind of Lysias did not err
greatly.</p>

<p>"Something is concealed from me as to this swift one,"
he said to himself. "I have no business in Samaria that
I should risk being robbed and then imprisoned as a thief.
But if I now meet a Roman patrol, no officer will deem
me a pirate coming ashore from a burning trireme with a
band of Saxons."</p>

<p>Therefore he blessed his gods for guiding him to the
house of Ben Assur, and he rode on in safety, but not as
yet was there any safety for the others who, like him, had
escaped the sea and the fire. Far behind him on Mount
Carmel, in a place of few trees, an Ionian sailor fell
breathless upon the grass while beside him halted a
Roman horseman.</p>

<p>"Get thee up!" he shouted. "Answer truly lest I slay
thee! Where are thy companions?"</p>

<p>"Slain by robbers in the armor of Saxons," responded
the fallen man, rising. "I will tell thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Another horseman came galloping to the side of the
first and legionaries on foot might be seen not far away.
The wisdom of a commander had sent a band of searchers
to the side of Carmel toward the plain rather than
among the crags and forests.</p>

<p>Gaining his breath as he could, for he had been running
swiftly, the Ionian told all save that he claimed to have
swam to the shore.</p>

<p>"Thou sawest but three of these Saxons?" said the officer
at last. "I had no knowledge of any such pirate
trireme. The Saxons are to be the scourge of the Middle
Sea if Cæsar destroyeth them not."</p>

<p>More questions were put to the frightened Ionian, and
then he was told:</p>

<p>"I will not slay thee. Thou wilt come with me to
Samaria. Thy testimony must go before the procurator
that a fleet may cruise against these rovers from the ocean
stream. Thy companions that remain must be sought
out that they may confirm thee."</p>

<p>Calm and wise was this man, and he at once sent forward,
also, swift runners to ask here and there if anything
had been seen of a band, or of single men, of the
Saxons who had escaped from the trireme.</p>

<p>Now the plain of Esdraelon is wide and the skirts of
Carmel are long and rugged. There were none who had
seen Ulric the Jarl and his vikings up to the hour when
they walked out into the highway. By his directions, as
a prudent captain, they marched orderly, two and two, as
if they belonged to the auxiliary of some Roman legion
and were going by due authority.</p>

<p>"So," advised Ben Ezra, "no man less than a quaternion
or a magistrate will run the risk of asking thee a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
question. No man of the people may demand the errand
of a soldier lest harm come to him."</p>

<p>"The multitude hath paused," said Sigurd. "They
gather around a man. Let us go see."</p>

<p>Right and left parted the crowd as the Saxon column
marched onward, but it halted suddenly, the people closing
around and behind it, curiously staring, but not
touching nor inquiring whence it came.</p>

<p>There was an open space on the broad highway, and
five paces in front of the jarl stood the man of whom
Sigurd had spoken. He was of full height and broad,
but Ulric said in a low tone to Ben Ezra, in Latin:</p>

<p>"He looketh not altogether like a Jew. I have seen
darker Saxons. I think he is a jarl. Such as he might be
a leader of men."</p>

<p>Proud was the bearing of Sigurd, the son of Thorolf,
the sea king; high and stern was the aspect of Ulric, the
son of Odin; tall and powerful men were all the other
vikings; but not among them all was there one with the
dignity of this plainly dressed Jew rabbi, who stood there
unarmed and with only a turban on his head.</p>

<p>He spoke not now to the Saxons, but before him on the
earth rolled and wallowed one who seemed in agony.
His eyes were starting from their sockets and there was
foam upon his lips. A shriek burst from him as his convulsed
limbs beat the earth.</p>

<p>"He hath a demon!" said Ben Ezra to Ulric. "The
evil spirit teareth him. There are many such. Let us
see what this rabbi will do. I think him a learned one.
Only the learned may deal with demons."</p>

<p>"Come out of him!" commanded the princely man,
stooping to touch the demoniac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>On his face was a kindly smile, nevertheless, but they
saw not his eyes, for he was looking downward.</p>

<p>Wild was the shriek that came back, as if in a fiercer
spasm of inward pain, but a voice followed it, saying:</p>

<p>"I know thee, who thou art, thou Jesus of Nazareth!
Thou holy one of God!"</p>

<p>Again he said, "Come out of him!" and it was as if
some unseen being called out loudly in an unknown
tongue and fled away.</p>

<p>Then arose from the ground the man in whom the evil
spirit had been dwelling, and he stood erect, unharmed,
like other men.</p>

<p>"A great rabbi!" whispered Ben Ezra. "One of the
learned, from Jerusalem. Thou mayest not speak to him
while he is healing."</p>

<p>"He that fled called him a son of Odin," replied Ulric.
"He looketh like one."</p>

<p>"He may be one of the gods of this land," muttered
Wulf the Skater. "I like him not. He commandeth evil
spirits and they obey him. I am glad the jarl is also a
son of Odin."</p>

<p>"I am glad to have seen a god," replied Knud the Bear.
"He is nobler than other men. Let us see what he will
do to that crippled one."</p>

<p>Bent and deformed, as if his arms and legs had little
shape left them, was this man whom his friends now half
led, half carried, before this rabbi of the Jews.</p>

<p>"Canst thou do anything for him?" asked one. "He
hath been thus from his birth."</p>

<p>No answer made the man Jesus, but he laid his hand
upon the arm of the crippled one.</p>

<p>"Odin!" exclaimed Ulric. "Look! He can stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
upon his feet! He lifteth his hands! Thou art right,
Ben Ezra. It were evil for me to speak. The cripple
singeth! He is praising his god, and well he may."</p>

<p>"Go thou to the priest at Jerusalem," he heard the
rabbi from Nazareth say to each in turn of the men who
had been cured. "See thou tell no man."</p>

<p>"What meaneth he?" thought Ulric. "Have not all we
seen with our own eyes this which hath been done? I
would I were healed of something, then would I know
what is this secret between them and their god. He is a
strong one. What will Ben Ezra now say about his
Jehovah? I think this may be a stronger god, for
Jehovah doth not well guard the Jews from the Romans."</p>

<p>But there stood the rabbi, Jesus, and he was saying
many things to the multitude. Clear was his voice and
deep, and they who were not near him needed not to lose
a word that he was saying.</p>

<p>"I understand him not," muttered Sigurd. "I am
glad to have seen him, but he is not like our gods of the
North. It is time we were marching, O jarl."</p>

<p>"Haste then," added Ben Ezra. "This Jesus is a
learned rabbi, and he healeth, but the swords of the
Romans are not far behind us."</p>

<p>"I would have speech with him before I go," said Ulric
to Ben Ezra. "What is this that he saith concerning unending
life? Do we not all die? Do we not all go to the
gods? He is lying. It is not good for a son of Odin to
lie."</p>

<p>"Speak to him not," said Ben Ezra. "He is touching
the sick. Never before have I seen a rabbi like this."</p>

<p>"He is of the seed of David," said a short, dark man
who stood near. "He is the Christ that was to come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
He is yet to be our King. I am one of his disciples. I
shall be a prince when he is crowned."</p>

<p>"Thou a prince?" said Ulric. "Thou lookest not like a
captain of warriors. What couldst thou do in a feast of
swords?"</p>

<p>The short man shrank away chinking a small bag that
was attached to his belt, and his black eyes were glittering
with anger.</p>

<p>"If I were a king," said Ulric, "I would find me better
captains than he. I like not his face. He loveth his bag
too well. Come on, now!"</p>

<p>The order went to his Saxons, but at that moment he
heard the rabbi saying: "Let him sell all that he hath
and come and follow me. So shall he have treasure in
the heavens."</p>

<p>"Where are they, Ben Ezra?" asked the jarl.</p>

<p>"No man knoweth," replied Ben Ezra. "I think they
are above the sky. It is the place of our people. Thou
art a heathen and they have no part with Israel."</p>

<p>"I go to Valhalla and to the city of Asgard," said
Ulric. "To the city of the gods. I want no treasure in
any place of the Jews. Thou mayest have thy heavens
to thyself. Lead on!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ulric strode forward and stood for a
moment before the rabbi looking him in the face.</p>

<p>"O thou of the sons of the gods," he said, "I also am
of the line of Odin. I think thou wouldst make a leader
of men. I will fight for thee if thou wilt."</p>

<p>"Thou art not far from the kingdom," said the rabbi,
smiling wonderfully. "Go thou thy way, for thou wilt
see me again. Thou wilt come unto me in the day in
which I shall call thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will I!" exclaimed Ulric with an energy that
was sudden. "But I think thou wilt need all the Saxons
if thou art to contend with Cæsar. It will be a great battle
when his legions meet thee. I have slain many
Romans already. I am thy man."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest not yet what thou art," replied the
rabbi, "but the Saxons also are my people. I shall send
for them."</p>

<p>"That do thou," said Ulric; "and I, Ulric the Jarl, the son
of Brander the Brave, the son of Odin, I will lead them
for thee, for I am a jarl and a sea king. Fare thee well."</p>

<p>No answer made the rabbi, for he turned to speak to a
woman in the crowd, and Ulric turned to walk away with
Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>"The Romans will slay him," said Ben Ezra. "Thou
wert imprudent. I wonder much. Can this be the Christ
that is to come?"</p>

<p>"Who, then, is he?" asked Ulric, and as they went
onward the Jew told him many things that were hard to
understand.</p>

<p>"It seemeth to me," said the jarl at last, "that thou
speakest a saga that Hilda of the hundred years told me in
my childhood. Odin is to return bringing the gods with
him, and some say he hath returned already and that he
who saileth far enough to the eastward and southward
may find Asgard. I must see this city, Jerusalem, and
its temple, for now I do know that thy Jehovah is a god
like Thor or Odin."</p>

<p>"He is the greatest of all gods," said Ben Ezra stoutly,
"but this rabbi cannot be the Christ. He is but a healer,
and there have been many who wrought cures and cast
out demons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would he had been with us in <i>The Sword</i>," replied
Ulric, "in the day when the evil spirit took possession of
my vikings. But he could have done nothing against the
Nornir and the valkyrias. Even Odin could not prevent
their calling. It was the time for those men to die."</p>

<p>"I heard this demon that was cast out by the rabbi,"
said Ben Ezra, "but I did not see him. I wonder what he
is like?"</p>

<p>"I have heard that such are exceedingly wonderful,"
said Ulric. "They are of many shapes, but none are
beautiful. Some of them are strong and the gods have
to tie them up to trees lest they do mischief."</p>

<p>"So have I heard," said the Jew, "only the demons tied
up by thy gods are not like our own. We have many,
and they seize men by night. They serve the magicians."</p>

<p>"I would slay all magicians," said Ezra. "They interfere
with the gods too much. But I see the glint of
spears away yonder. I trust there are not too many of
them."</p>

<p>They had marched far into Esdraelon and the night
was falling. The men were weary and their hearts were
heavy.</p>

<p>"Be thou prudent," said Ben Ezra. "If this be a
Roman patrol, smite not, but let me have speech with their
officer."</p>

<p>"We may not flee," replied the jarl. "Not only are
we overworn, but these are in part mounted men. Silence
all! They come!"</p>

<p>The Saxons halted, leaning upon their spears, not
knowing the purpose of their jarl, but trusting him. On
toward them rode but three, of whom one wore a white
cloak with a purple border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"A Roman of high rank," said Ben Ezra. "Slay him
not. The band is strong."</p>

<p>Not loudly uttered was the hail of the Roman officer,
reining his horse.</p>

<p>"I am Julius, the centurion of Tiberias," he said. "I
know ye, who ye are&mdash;the gladiators of Caius from Jerusalem
for the games at Tiberias. Ye have taken the
wrong road. Who art thou, O Jew?"</p>

<p>"I am Ben Ezra, their interpreter," replied the Jew.
"Were we not forbidden to go by the way of Jezreel?"</p>

<p>The centurion laughed freely at that.</p>

<p>"Caius is careful of his wagers and would not have thy
men seen by the wrong eyes," he said, "but I have had
fortune to beat his cunning by this meeting. I will look
well at them. They seem better than any that may be
now ready to contend with them."</p>

<p>"Study them well," said Ben Ezra, and the centurion
rode slowly around the motionless body of Saxons.</p>

<p>"Would I might slay him!" muttered Knud the Bear,
but none heard.</p>

<p>"He is a fine mark!" whispered Wulf the Skater. "I
could spear him off his horse. But the jarl is cunning."</p>

<p>"Cease," said Tostig the Red. "The legionaries are
twoscore and we are weary."</p>

<p>"O thou," said Julius to Ulric, discovering that he was
the captain, "thou art a tall one."</p>

<p>"He understandeth Latin," said Ben Ezra. "He is not
new, as are the others."</p>

<p>"He looketh a tried swordsman," said Julius, for one
soldier judgeth easily another. "Saxon, thou wilt win
sesterces at Tiberias, but thou wilt lose some of thy company."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not unless ye have better swords than any we have
met," replied Ulric.</p>

<p>"Truly!" exclaimed Julius, "this is a deep trick of
Caius. He will get no foolish wagers from me. But
thou, O Saxon, thou wilt have a Numidian lion to fight,
and he is larger than any Syrian beast. What sayest thou
to that? Canst thou meet him?"</p>

<p>"Judge thou of that when thou seest him before me,"
said Ulric. "I would gladly meet thy lion if he is a
strong one."</p>

<p>"Hard fighters are the Saxons," said Julius. "I will
give thy big Hercules a tiger."</p>

<p>He pointed at Sigurd, and the sea king's face flushed
hotly, but he was silent.</p>

<p>"O Jew," said the centurion, "obey thou Caius lest thou
get the scourge. Enter not Jezreel. Show not thy gladiators
to any. Tell not any man that I have seen them
and I will give thee ten sesterces. If thou tellest, I will
reward thee otherwise. Go on a little. Camp in the old
tower by the highway from Galilee. It hath now no garrison.
Thy Saxon wolves are guard enough against
jackals and robbers."</p>

<p>"I obey thee, O noble Julius," said Ben Ezra. "Thou
wilt answer for us if we are inquired of concerning this
tower?"</p>

<p>"I will acquit thee," replied the centurion, and he rode
away followed by his own company.</p>

<p>All that had been spoken was now interpreted to the
Saxons, and it seemed to them as if a good jest had been
made of this Roman. They were glad, also, of a sure
camping place, and they marched on in the twilight; but
the Jew purchased for them two fat sheep and a skin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
wine at a place which they passed in going. Then came
they to the empty tower at the highway from Galilee, but
when they halted Ben Ezra would allow none to enter
until he had kindled a flame and had made torches.</p>

<p>"These old towers are abodes of demons," he said,
"and the rabbi Jesus is not here to cast them out. This
Julius may have played a trick upon us, sending us to contend
with evil spirits which have heretofore driven all
garrisons out of this place."</p>

<p>"Have thou thy will," said the jarl. "But a son of
Odin careth not much for demons."</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Tomb Song of Sigurd.</small></span></h2>


<p>The broken portal of the old tower in Esdraelon was
as the entrance to a dark cavern, and from it came out a
wide-winged owl while Ben Ezra was kindling his flame.
Away into the darkness fled the bird of night hooting
loudly, and the men said to one another:</p>

<p>"We like not these birds. They are of evil omen.
They are friendly with bad spirits and the demons have
them for their companions."</p>

<p>Ulric the Jarl stood waiting, and he cared not for the
owl, but when a torch was handed to him by the Jew he
strode forward, looking warily around him as he went,
and others followed him closely.</p>

<p>Naught was there to be seen but bare walls of stone
and a flight of stone steps that were builded spirally, leading
upward.</p>

<p>"O jarl!" suddenly exclaimed Tostig the Red, going
past him, sword in hand, "here, also, are other steps.
Look! They go down into the under world. Beneath
this tower might be vaults and a prison."</p>

<p>"Such places are ever the abode of the evil spirits," said
Ben Ezra. "Go not down this at first. It is likely there
have been many men slain here, for this tower hath been
a place of defense since the old time. It was builded by
the Philistines, but the stonework hath been repaired by
the kings of the nations who came after them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Easy it was to obtain enough of fuel for a bright fire
upon the stone floor, and the Saxons loved the light of its
blaze, although little need was for warmth. There was a
well near by, with a bucket for bringing up water and a
trough for beasts to drink from. They who planned the
tower had provided wisely, but Ben Ezra said of the deep
well:</p>

<p>"Many are the demons which dwell in old wells. They
entice men to fall in, and they themselves come out to deal
evilly with lone wayfarers. Therefore some who encamp
by the wells are heard of no more. Only the very
learned of the rabbis know how to cast them out. Let
us hope that this fountain hath been purified."</p>

<p>"The water is good," said Knud the Bear, "and I was
thirsty. The gods make wells."</p>

<p>They ate and drank, and then Ulric the Jarl knew that
it was his duty to further explore the tower. He first
climbed the stone stairway to the upper part. Here was
no roof, and the walls were notched well for bowmen.
There was a place, also, for the burning of a beacon light.</p>

<p>"It is a strong tower," said the jarl. "A few men
might keep it against many if the portal had a stout gate
with arrow holes. We are garrison enough. I will go
down."</p>

<p>The stars above were bright, but there was no moon,
and nothing could he discern of the plain or of the mountains.
He descended the stairway and went to the downward
steps, taking a larger torch but asking no company.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Sigurd, "have a care for thyself. Thou
knowest not who may be the god of this place."</p>

<p>"Odin!" laughed Ulric. "Whoever he may be he hath
not hindered our coming in. I will see what is below."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>None followed him but Tostig the Red, who was ever
curious and who had no fear of demons, thinking them
of no account.</p>

<p>"O jarl," he said, at the bottom of the steps, "hold up
thy torch. This winding stairway hath taken us down
two fathoms or more. There is a bad smell. I like it
not. I hear something that moveth."</p>

<p>"Help me! For the sake of Jehovah the Blessed!"
gasped a human voice not far away. "I perish with
thirst. They bound me and left me here to die."</p>

<p>He spoke in the old Hebrew tongue, not unlike the
tongue which was commonly spoken in that land, and
Ulric answered:</p>

<p>"Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"I am Abbas, the merchant, of Jerusalem," responded
the voice. "Water! Water! They were robbers from
Mount Gilboa. I was rash, for I had little treasure with
me. They got but my ass and a bag of denarii, and they
were wroth to have so little. This was their hiding place,
but they are gone out for prey."</p>

<p>Over him stood Ulric, holding the torch, while Tostig
with his knife cut the hempen fetters and lifted Abbas to
his feet. He was naked save a torn tunic, but he did not
seem to be wounded. The Saxons above had heard, and
a horn of water was brought down by Sigurd, the son of
Thorolf, for Ben Ezra was outside of the tower. Abbas
drank, gaining strength, and went up the stairway with
little help, while Tostig searched that place in vain for
anything worth the taking.</p>

<p>"They take their spoils elsewhere," he muttered, "but
we will care little for that if Odin hath sent us the slaying
of them. I would be glad to kill some robbers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Men in Galilee owed me money for merchandise," explained
Abbas as he ate. "I came to obtain it, thinking
to return in strong company. The Romans make the
highways safe to all, and I had no fear. But this band
numbereth a score. I think they will return before the
morning."</p>

<p>"Put out the fire!" commanded the jarl. "Every man
to his spear and shield. We will not let one of them
escape. It is evil to leave a man to die of thirst instead of
giving him the sword."</p>

<p>"The Romans will thank thee well, O chief of the
gladiators," said Abbas. "They have striven to destroy
these robbers of Gilboa, but if these are pressed hardly,
they flee across the Jordan. They are from the wilderness."</p>

<p>Ben Ezra heard standing in the doorway, and he already
knew all. To Ulric he said in the North tongue:</p>

<p>"Beware whom thou slayest. Thou art but a gladiator
in this tower. Thou art not here a jarl, to do as thou
wilt."</p>

<p>"Ever am I a son of Odin," said Ulric. "I have sold
my sword to no man. Who shall stay me from slaying?
I will spare not one."</p>

<p>"If thou slayest one, slay all," said Ben Ezra. "There
is danger in the enmity of the men of the wilderness.
They forget not, and the next of kin may find thee."</p>

<p>"Not if he be wise," said Ulric, but he bade his men lie
down and rest, keeping watches.</p>

<p>Then spoke to him the Jew Abbas:</p>

<p>"I will tell thee a thing. Me they may have thought to
ransom. I know not. But they will be here at the dawn
to lie in wait for a company that cometh from Tiberias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
with much merchandise. Thou mayest be sure that, if
thou slayest them not, then thou and all of thine are to be
slain."</p>

<p>"That I may well believe," said the jarl, "but they who
slay Saxons may count their men and we will count how
many remain."</p>

<p>"So be it," said Abbas. "Thou art a tall one. But
thou, Ben Ezra, come hither and commune with me."</p>

<p>So went they apart and they talked much together in
the old Hebrew tongue, and it seemed to the jarl that
these two Jews might be of kin to each other, so many
names did they speak of men and of women and of
places.</p>

<p>"I will trust Ben Ezra," he thought, "but of this Abbas
I shall know more at another time. I would see the sun
upon his face before I can read its meaning."</p>

<p>Then came around him and Sigurd all the other Saxons
asking curiously concerning all these things which had
taken place. They asked about the tower and the plain
and the mountains until they were satisfied.</p>

<p>"Thou art a prudent jarl," said Tostig the Red, "but I
would rather fight lions than to be hidden away among
the hills like a wolf. Are there not cities to be seen, and
wonderful places? I like not deserts."</p>

<p>"We came out to see the world," said Knud the Bear.
"O jarl, there might be excellent fighting if we go in the
right direction."</p>

<p>"That would please me also," said Wulf the Skater,
"and we may begin with these robbers if they are to come
upon us. They may be swordsmen."</p>

<p>Other of the vikings spoke strongly, as became warriors,
and Ulric saw that they were in earnest. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
liked not Gilboa and its caves. They had been shut up
on shipboard long and they were in great wonder concerning
this country of the Jews.</p>

<p>"Even so am I," Ulric said to them. "We will go on
and see cities, as you desire. We will not be Roman soldiers,
but there is no disgrace to a Northman in slaying
a fighting beast or a fighting man. Only I will serve no
master, even though he be a king. I am of Odin."</p>

<p>"We are as thou art in this matter," said the Saxons.
"We will serve none save in thy company, but we pray
thee lead us into a better place than this tower or a
desert."</p>

<p>Now, also, some remembered to speak again of Lysias,
the Greek, wondering whether or not he had escaped and
where he might be. "Ought we not rather to have slain
him?" they said. "Who knoweth what report he may
send out concerning us?"</p>

<p>"He will have good care for his own life in that matter,"
said the jarl. "He will be secret for his own sake.
Do ye not also remember that he is a good bowman?"</p>

<p>"I like him for his archery," said Tostig the Red. "I
trust that his gods may be with him to help him slay more
Romans."</p>

<p>"That seemeth not to be for us," said Knud the Bear.
"We are to be friends with them for a season. But I
would see a tiger if I may, and also some of these great
elephants, which cause me to think of a whale walking
upon the land."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt see them at Tiberias if thou goest there,"
said Ben Ezra; "but be careful of thy speech, for thou art
now in a Roman land and thou art but one man. Thou
canst not fight a cohort."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"A warrior may be prudent without dishonor," responded
Knud. "I like the Romans better, now I have
killed so many of them. They are good fighters and they
die where they stand, not running away."</p>

<p>So said other of the Saxons, and all slept but the
watchers, and the night passed.</p>

<p>It was in the dull hour before the sun's rising that
Abbas, the Jew, came to the jarl and touched him, saying:</p>

<p>"Arise, O captain of the Saxons. The sentinel at the
roadside needeth thee."</p>

<p>"Stir up the men," spoke Ulric to Sigurd, the son of
Thorolf, "but bid them keep in the tower. Come thou
unto me at the road."</p>

<p>So went he out and stood by the sentinel, and with them
were Ben Ezra and Abbas.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Wulf the Skater, "I might not leave my
post, but I have slain this man that lieth here. What he
is I know not, but he crept near me stealthily and I
speared him. It was a cast in the dark. He weareth a
turban."</p>

<p>"A robber from beyond Jordan," said Abbas stooping.
"He is a bowman. Therefore there are others
with him. What sayest thou, captain of the Saxons?"</p>

<p>"Let no man speak loudly," said Ulric. "Bring no
light. I hear horses. Be ready. Slay all who come,
but give no warning."</p>

<p>So did Sigurd, the son of Thorolf, give direction in the
tower, and the men were prudent, waiting for what might
come. But Sigurd now stood by Ulric and seemed like
a giant in the gloom. By him stood another Saxon
quickly, and he was lifting his shield when something
smote it, making it ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"An arrow," he said, "sent strongly. A dozen men,
O jarl!"</p>

<p>"Smitten am I!" shouted Sigurd, but he sprang forward
swinging his pole ax.</p>

<p>Upon him darkly, suddenly, pressed hard a swarm of
men, and they were as locusts crushed by the foot as his
ax fell on them.</p>

<p>Ulric stood fast for a moment, but forward with
Sigurd went Wulf the Skater full of war wrath. More
than one arrow rattled on the shield of the jarl, but he had
cast his spear and he was now swinging the long, straight
sword of Annibaal, the Carthaginian, for men were upon
him and he mowed them as rushes.</p>

<p>"Back to the tower, Ben Ezra!" exclaimed Abbas.</p>

<p>Past Abbas and Ben Ezra charged four Saxons with
Knud the Bear; but the two Jews went back to the tower,
for they were cunning and they willed not to be discovered
by these robbers whose vengeance is forever.</p>

<p>Men half armored, moderate in stature, not expecting
great resistance, were without hope in such a fray as this.
They were there to be slaughtered, but at a little distance
were others who were on horseback. From among these
rode one a little nearer, while the others withheld their
archery for fear of hitting their own men.</p>

<p>"O Abbas, of Jerusalem!" he shouted. "Would we
had slain thee at once! Thou hast betrayed us to the
Romans. I will yet have revenge upon thee and upon
thy son. Thou art the father of that Bar Abbas that
smote me and mine beyond Machærus. May the Romans
crucify him!"</p>

<p>Abbas at the tower heard well, but he replied not, and
the Saxons were slaying fast the robbers who were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
foot. Not one of them escaped, so swiftly fell the steel of
the strong ones from the Northland.</p>

<p>Again shouted the man, the robber chief on horseback,
shouting to his footmen, but no voice went back to him.
Only a spear thrown by Knud the Bear went through him
from breast to back and Ulric blew a blast upon his war
horn, for he heard a clash of swords behind him.</p>

<p>"It is naught!" shouted Tostig the Red, from the doorway.
"We were three and with us were the two Jews.
Some thieves who came here are dead, dying easily.
Fight on."</p>

<p>Loud were the shouts of wrath among the horsemen,
and one was interpreted by Abbas to Ulric:</p>

<p>"He saith 'a Roman garrison is in the tower.' No robber
will venture nearer."</p>

<p>"Woe to thee, Abbas!" came fiercely out of the gloom.
"Woe to thee and thine! I curse thee by my gods for
ever and ever!"</p>

<p>No word spoke Abbas, but the horsemen wheeled and
rode away swiftly, while Ulric stooped over one who lay
upon the ground.</p>

<p>"O son of Thorolf!" he exclaimed, "I would thou hadst
not been smitten."</p>

<p>"That am I," said Sigurd. "The valkyrias have not
passed me by. It was the arrow in the dark, and the
bowman was near and it pierced my mail."</p>

<p>"Thou didst fight well, being smitten," said Ulric, "for
thou art of the heroes."</p>

<p>"Burn me not," said Sigurd, "but bury me by this
tower, in my armor, laying my weapons with me. I may
need them when I awake among the gods. I know not
much of these matters, but I have great curiosity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye," said Ulric, "and if thou seest Hilda of the hundred
years, thou mayest tell her where I am. Speak thou
also to my father, to Brander the Brave, the sea king.
Tell him I go on to Asgard, and that I have seen one of
the gods in this land and that I seek to see him again."</p>

<p>"I also saw him there in the road," said Sigurd. "I
think him one of them by his face and by the word of the
evil spirits. If thou meetest him again, greet him for me.
Give me thy hand, Ulric the Jarl! The valkyrias! Odin!"</p>

<p>Half sprang to his feet the mighty son of Thorolf and
he uttered a great cry. Then crashing heavily down he
fell prostrate, his shield and his mail clanging. Silently
around him stood the Saxons, and one of them said:</p>

<p>"O jarl, so fall we, one by one. I like it not. We shall
never again see the Northland. The gods are against us!"</p>

<p>"He died not in his bed," said Knud the Bear. "It is
well with him, Jarl Ulric."</p>

<p>"So die I!" exclaimed Wulf the Skater. "Come! Let
us dig, for the ravens must not whet their beaks on the
bones of the hero."</p>

<p>Therefore, with knives and spearheads and flat stones
the Saxons dug a deep hollow in the earth, and into it
the sun looked down when he was risen.</p>

<p>"It will do," said Ulric; "but now we will eat and drink.
We have slain eighteen of these robbers. I would we had
slain them all."</p>

<p>Many coins had been found upon the dead, especially
upon him who had been mounted, and all these the jarl
divided among the men, Ben Ezra counting for him their
value.</p>

<p>"Keep thou some," said Knud the Bear.</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Ulric. "I have enough. I like not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
too many coins. Ye may need them to buy with. What
have I to do with such things?"</p>

<p>"Thou art jarl," reasoned Knud. "If thou take them
not now we will yet compel thee. Thou canst not do altogether
as thou wilt. We think thou wilt need many
coins. They are the custom of this land."</p>

<p>"So be it," said Ulric. "I am learning much about
them. But I would rather be rich in cattle and in horses.
I have all the lands of Brander. I think I will take some
coins with me when I go, to keep them in a bag like old
Oswald, the harper."</p>

<p>"We will pay ours here, I think," said Knud. "But let
the Jew make thy bargains for thee; for the sons of Odin
are not good merchants."</p>

<p>Ben Ezra spoke then, agreeing well with Knud, but the
heart of Ulric was heavy because of Sigurd, for the son of
Thorolf had kept good faith with him, and the men who
are true to friends are the men who are most missed when
the valkyrias come to them.</p>

<p>There were eating and drinking and there was much
curious examination of the weapons and clothing and
armor of the robbers from beyond Jordan. Ben Ezra
and Abbas answered all questions, but they said, also, that
there must be no going away from the tower until a
messenger should arrive from Julius or from some other
Roman officer.</p>

<p>Even while he was saying this to Ulric there was heard
from the southward along the highway the sound of a
trumpet.</p>

<p>"Whoever cometh," said Ben Ezra, "let me have first
speech with him. In slaying these who lie here we have
been under the orders of Julius, the centurion, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
official responsibility is to him; but he referreth us to
Caius, of the household of the procurator at Jerusalem.
We have need of cunning."</p>

<p>The sun was high now, and Esdraelon was exceedingly
beautiful between its mountains. It was a plain of brown
and green under blue heavens, a place where the gods
might walk; but Ulric, the son of Brander, listened to the
trumpet and looked from the bodies of the dead to the
Saxons, who stood in line on guard at the roadside.</p>

<p>"This is the valley of battles," he said, aloud. "O Jew,
I will heed thee. Knowest thou anything of this Julius?"</p>

<p>"Not of myself," said Ben Ezra, "but Abbas knoweth
of him that he is said to be a subtle serpent, winning much
money on wagers, and that he is cruel."</p>

<p>"Mark thou this, then," said Ulric. "I saw in his face
a thing that I read better now that we have lost a brave
swordsman. Deal thou carefully with these who come.
I like not this place where too many have fallen, and
where thou sayest the multitudes are to perish in the latter
days."</p>

<p>Dark was the brow of the young jarl, and he went and
stood by the open tomb and by the body of Sigurd, the son
of Thorolf.</p>

<p>Out stepped Ben Ezra into the highway, and he stood
there making due obeisance and uttering a greeting, when
a Roman officer wearing a white cloak with a purple
border drew rein before him.</p>

<p>"I am Caius, of Thessalonica," said the Roman. "Who
art thou and who are these?"</p>

<p>"If thou art Caius, thou art well arrived," said Ben
Ezra. "Thy swordsmen rested here at the command of
Julius, the centurion, and I have somewhat to tell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"These, then, were hired for me by that traitor Hyles?"
suddenly exclaimed Caius, in wrath. "And he sent them
on to be murdered by Julius? Thou knowest not that
Hyles was slain in Samaria yesterday? Tell all!"</p>

<p>Rapidly spoke the Jew, while other horsemen and four
chariots halted near in the highway.</p>

<p>Caius dismounted and walked on to where Ulric stood,
and the jarl greeted him, pointing down at Sigurd.</p>

<p>"So! I have lost a good sword by this Julius," exclaimed
Caius. "He meant me to lose all that he might
win the games. Are any more of thy men hurt?"</p>

<p>"None," said Ulric in Latin, "but this was a chief, a
hero, a leader of men. Him we must bury before we
march."</p>

<p>"I, too, am a soldier!" shouted Caius. "He was a brave
man! Bury him according to thy custom. Thinkest
thou I am a dog? I, too, will stand by. Brave men
grow scarce. I would that Cæsar had ten legions of such
as thou art. The new levies are dwarfs!"</p>

<p>Out went the hand of Ulric freely, for the man's face
had scars on it and he was of good stature.</p>

<p>"I will go with thee," he said. "I am Ulric the Jarl,
of the sons of Odin. It was promised me that I should
have a lion to slay and that I should see Jerusalem. Wilt
thou keep faith with me?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Caius. "I will give thee not to a lion; but
thou shalt go where thou wilt, and then thou shalt see
Rome and fight before Cæsar. Wait till thou hast seen
this lion prepared for thy destruction. I am not thine
enemy to betray thee to ruin."</p>

<p>"I will wait," said Ulric, but he turned and beckoned to
the Saxons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>All came and they took up the body of Sigurd, laying
it in the deep tomb.</p>

<p>"Put in stones and earth," said Ulric; but Caius, of
Thessalonica, stepped forward and threw in the first
handful.</p>

<p>"Cunning is he," whispered Abbas to Ben Ezra. "He
knoweth men. He is winning these Saxons for himself.
There are no men more cunning than the Romans."</p>

<p>Slowly filled they the tomb, but Ulric stood at the head,
looking down, and he said aloud: "Who shall sing the
tomb song of Sigurd, the son of Thorolf?"</p>

<p>"Thou, O jarl," said Knud the Bear. "We have no
harp nor any saga woman. Sing thou to the hero and to
the gods."</p>

<p>Song came upon the soul of Ulric and his lips opened&mdash;and
it was as if Hilda were with him, for he sang wonderfully.
There were women in the chariots and they sat
listening to the musical voice of the jarl. The legionaries
on the horses sat like statues. The Saxons waited,
holding each his war horn in his hand, as did the jarl,
until the tomb was filled, and they laid a broad stone
thereon from a ruined part of the tower.</p>

<p>Ulric lifted his war horn and all the rest did likewise,
answering his blast and then shouting. He blew again
and he cried out:</p>

<p>"O Sigurd, son of Thorolf, the sea king, I have done as
thou didst bid me. Bear thou my messages to the dead.
Tell them I come. Keep thou a place for me in Valhalla,
in the day when the valkyrias come for me."</p>

<p>"Thou hast bidden farewell to thy comrade," said
Caius, frankly. "What doest thou with the corpses of
these robbers?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let the ravens and the wolves care for that matter,"
said Ulric. "They are not ours."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the Roman, for there was pride in the
manner of the jarl. "Such work is for slaves, not for
thee. An officer will do whatever is needful. Prepare
thee to march for Tiberias. Thou wilt have good quarters,
near the amphitheater. No man may molest thee,
O chief of the Saxons. I like thee well, and I would thy
tall comrade were living. Subtle indeed is Julius, the
gambler, but he hath obtained only the slaying of robbers,
and the quæstor will but laugh as at a jest."</p>

<p>Well pleased were all the Saxons at the respect shown
to them and to their jarl, but they went and looked curiously
at the chariots in the highway. They studied well
the wheels and the harness, but most of all did they gaze
at the charioteers.</p>

<p>"Now," said Knud the Bear, "I believe that which was
told me, for I have seen black men. I must slay one some
day that I may know the color of his blood and of his
flesh. They have strange hair, also, and they wear arm
rings of silver and rings in their noses and in their ears."</p>

<p>"Those women are like other women," thought Ulric.
"Not yet have I seen her who stood by Hilda in my
dreams. She is tenfold more beautiful than any of these."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, haste was made, and when the trumpet
sounded the march the Saxons were ready for the highway;
but it was after the middle of the day, and Ben Ezra
had all directions for the way. On went the chariots and
the horsemen, and then Ulric and his men followed,
saluting first the tomb of Sigurd.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>In a Place Apart at Night.</small></span></h2>


<p>"Halt thou! This is the place provided for thy band."</p>

<p>So said to Ulric the Jarl the Roman soldier who stood
in the highway before the inn.</p>

<p>It was near the setting of the sun and the Saxons were
weary with the heat. They were thirsty, likewise, and
they were glad of a light red wine which was brought to
them, but Ulric said to the bringers:</p>

<p>"For me water only. I fear much the evil spirit that
hideth in the wine of this land. I think he is mine enemy
and that my gods are at war with him."</p>

<p>So he drank only water, but they all went in to the supper
which had been ordered for them by Caius. They
talked not much with any, for the people of the inn were
afraid of them, and men and women and children of the
neighborhood who came to gaze did so as those who look
but in readiness to run away.</p>

<p>The place was but a hamlet in Esdraelon, and around it
were vineyards with many olive trees and fig trees.</p>

<p>There was a spirit of unrest upon Ulric, the son of
Brander, and his soul was troubled within him. He remained
not in the inn after supper, but walked out alone
fully armed. He conversed in Latin a brief space with
the soldier on duty there, asking him questions, and the
answers did not please him.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt feed the beasts of the circus right well,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
said the legionary scornfully. "They will be hungry
when they are let loose upon thee and thine. Thou art
no Roman. All barbarians are fit to be crucified."</p>

<p>Down into his face looked Ulric the Jarl. "O Roman,"
he said, "I am a match for seven such as thou art. I
could lift thee above my head and cast thee like a stone
from a sling. Well said Caius that these new legions
were worthless against the strong in battle. Thou hast
no part in Thor the Hammerer."</p>

<p>The soldier's face was dark with anger, but the jarl
laughed and passed on, and neither of them knew that
Knud the Bear in the door of the inn had been balancing
his spear.</p>

<p>"If he lifteth but a hand against the jarl, I will smite
him through!" muttered Knud. "The jarl is imprudent.
I like it not."</p>

<p>"Lower thy spear," said Ben Ezra near him. "There
will be no harm to thy chief. Thou art overhasty and
thou wilt soon die."</p>

<p>"There will be blood at my dying," said Knud. "I will
strike for the jarl if all the legions of Cæsar should
come."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Ben Ezra. "Thou wilt find a better hour
to use thy spear."</p>

<p>"So be it," replied Knud. "Thou art old and thou art
wise and thou hatest Romans."</p>

<p>On walked the jarl, but he was thinking, and the
thoughts in his mind were heated.</p>

<p>"Where am I now?" he said, but not aloud. "Where
is the good ship <i>The Sword</i>? Where are my companions
who sailed with me from the Northland? Where is
Asgard? I have seen one god, but when shall I look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
into his face again? When shall I find the maiden who
stood by Hilda? My heart is on fire when I think of her.
None like her was ever seen in the Northland. O Hilda,
canst thou tell me does this thy beautiful companion dwell
among the gods? Then will I go to them that I may
greet her, for she is mine."</p>

<p>Other thoughts came to be uttered, but he spoke them
not, and he walked onward into the deepening gloom.
Very dark it was until the moon arose, and he knew not
that the Saxons at the inn were inquiring angrily concerning
him.</p>

<p>"What are we if we lose our jarl?" said Wulf the
Skater. "But for him we had been lost long since. We
would have no more help of Odin if our jarl were taken
away."</p>

<p>Ben Ezra and Abbas pacified them, and Tostig the Red
said to the others:</p>

<p>"There are but few Romans near and they are bound
under Caius. What danger to the son of Brander were a
drove of these Syrian cattle, even if they were armed?"</p>

<p>"The son of Thorolf was slain by an arrow shot in the
dark," said a viking, surlily. "The jarl doeth not well
to go among arrows. I would see his face again."</p>

<p>Murmurs were many, and they all came out and stood
before the inn examining their weapons and tightening
their mail.</p>

<p>Ulric walked on, but not far, in the brightening moonlight.</p>

<p>"It is like the North country moon in winter," he said,
for the air was clear and many things could be seen as
in the day.</p>

<p>Beyond him arose a hill, such as may be in so great a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
plain, and on it there were ruins, grass-grown and mossy.
In the old time there had been here a castle or a pleasure
palace, none could tell which, and some of the stones were
large, arising as pillars with stones laid across their
summits.</p>

<p>"Not a temple," said Ulric, thoughtfully. "I hope not.
I would not go too near an abiding place of the dead gods.
Oft they come back again to trouble men. So saith Ben
Ezra. So saith Abbas. They hate men, for men worship
them no more."</p>

<p>He walked more slowly, thinking of the gods and of
Hilda and of the strangeness that he himself was here
without a ship or a strong company, and not knowing
what might be before him on the morrow.</p>

<p>"I am jarl no more," he began to say, but at that
moment he was suddenly silenced and he stood still to
listen.</p>

<p>Not many paces beyond him was an open space on the
summit of the hill and around it were fallen pillars, many
and great, made of white stone. From this open there
arose a voice and the light of the moon trembled among
the white pillars.</p>

<p>"He kneeleth!" said Ulric to himself. "Ben Ezra
called him the rabbi of Nazareth. If there be dead gods or
evil demons here, he feareth them not, for they know him."</p>

<p>Not loudly but with exceeding melody of voice the
tongue of the kneeling man spoke on, and Ulric said:</p>

<p>"He singeth not to the dead of this place. It is not a
saga of heroes. He asketh many things, that they may
be given him. I am glad of the old Hebrew tongue that
I understand him somewhat, but much that he speaketh
I do not understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>So he listened more, and the voice went on and the
moonlight fell gloriously upon the face of him who was
kneeling.</p>

<p>"I have been gone long from the inn," said Ulric in his
thoughts. "I must return, but I have learned a thing.
He is not alone here, as I am. The gods are with him,
and he talketh with them as one god may talk to another,
as friend to friend, right kindly. He is not at war with
them, and one of them is his father. I would it were
Odin, for I like this god and I like his asking for these
things that he needeth. I, too, need many things, but
Odin is far away and I know him not very well. The
face of a god is very beautiful in the moonlight. He is a
tall, strong man, a good fighter. But the gods have a
strength of their own, greater than that of men. They
can uproot trees and overturn rocks and drive the ice out
of the fiords. This god could do a great many mighty
things. I will have a talk with him some day, and I will
ask him concerning Asgard."</p>

<p>Ulric gazed earnestly at the face of Jesus of Nazareth,
but the closed eyes did not open and the wonderful voice
continued its many petitions.</p>

<p>"I would I might see some of the other gods," thought
the jarl, "but to remain here is not well. He hath come
to this place to be alone with his father and his friends,
and no brave warrior would be an intruder upon the
affairs of others. I will go."</p>

<p>He turned and walked away, but his thoughts were
dark and heavy within him.</p>

<p>"This man is of the sons of Odin," he said. "So am
I. Therefore he and I are of kin, and I would know
more of him. I would ask him concerning Hilda and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
father. If he may thus talk with the gods, my right is the
same. But he is more than I, for the evil spirits obey
him. He is no magician, to be friendly with them, but he
was not unkind to the demon whom he sent away. If I
were a god, I think I would deal well with demons and
make them fight for me."</p>

<p>So he communed with himself, walking, until he was
loudly greeted at the door of the inn.</p>

<p>"O jarl," shouted Knud, "thou art safe! I did not
know where to search for thee. It is wrong for thee to
leave us in this manner."</p>

<p>"O Knud," said Ulric, "I am not a child. The night
is quiet. Let us all sleep, for the march on the morrow
may be long, under a hot sun."</p>

<p>The others reproved him sharply, but they now were
glad to rest, and the night waned.</p>

<p>There was no sound of trumpet at the sun's rising, but
a quaternion of legionaries came and the guard was
changed. The officer also brought orders from Caius
that the gladiators should move on toward Galilee. Also
a chariot came to carry for them their burdens and their
heavier arms and armor, of which there was too much in
weight for those who would march rapidly.</p>

<p>"This is not a country for bearskins," said Knud.
"Even Wulf the Skater is willing to take off his mail and
his helmet. He never would do that thing until this day."</p>

<p>"There is no fighting to be done among these vineyards,"
said Wulf, "and I think this red wine maketh
one's blood hot. I am thinking that I would gladly see a
tiger."</p>

<p>"There will be nothing in this land greater to contend
with than was the white bear slain by Jarl Ulric," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Tostig the Red. "The children of the ice king were
strong ones. I would rejoice in ice and snow at this
hour."</p>

<p>"It will be long before thou art frozen, O red one,"
laughed another of the Saxons. "I am melting, like the
ice king."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt make less noise when thou fallest," said
Tostig. "But cause me not to remember too much the
sea and the good ship <i>The Sword</i>. Such thoughts bring
me to hate the land, and I listen for the washing of the
waves and for the cries of seabirds. It is not good, for
the sea is far away."</p>

<p>Silence came then and the Saxons walked on along the
highway, seeing all things as they went, but thinking of
the blue waters and of the plowing keels and of the North.
Ulric strode on in advance, and with him were Abbas and
Ben Ezra, telling him many things that he might not be
ignorant in his dealings with that which was before
him.</p>

<p>"Caius believeth," Ben Ezra told him, "that thou and
thy Saxons were engaged for him by his bondsman and
purveyor Hyles, who was slain at Samaria for cheating
him. We will have all care concerning that matter, but
Julius feareth Caius of Thessalonica because of his near
friendship with this Pontius the Spearman, who is master
of Judea and Samaria under Cæsar. Win thou the good
will of Caius, for he is a man of rank and gaineth power.
Only trust not any Roman, for they care not for the life
of a barbarian more than of a dog."</p>

<p>Ulric answered little, but he thought, and spoke it not.</p>

<p>"These twain are Jews, but one is as a free Northman,
a warrior, and the other is as a slave in spirit, fearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Romans even more than he hateth them. I like not
Abbas. He would sell me and mine as if we were cattle.
Ben Ezra proveth a true friend and I will abide by his
sayings. Here cometh a party!"</p>

<p>Looking along the highway at that moment, he saw
chariots and horsemen, but no flag nor any armor.</p>

<p>"Who are these?" he asked of Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>"Let them come nearer," said the Jew. "It is likely
they are travelers of importance. Halt thy men at the
roadside and we will see."</p>

<p>At the word the Saxons halted, leaving the road free,
and they were all willing to stand and watch this company
that came.</p>

<p>Four chariots there were, but the one which came first
was gilded and carven and was drawn by four white
horses. Over it was a silken canopy, and in it sat three
veiled women. Of these two were on a front seat, behind
the charioteers. He who drove was black and exceedingly
uncomely, and beside him sat a large brown man
bearing a spear and girded with a sword. These were
turbaned and their apparel was good, but not upon them
did the eyes of Ulric linger. On the back seat of the
chariot, half reclining, was the third woman, and he said
to himself:</p>

<p>"This is the princess and the others are her servants.
I would see a princess of this country."</p>

<p>Forward he strode three paces, and Knud said to Wulf
the Skater:</p>

<p>"How splendid is the youth of our jarl, with his golden
hair and his face like that of Odin! There is none other
like him!"</p>

"O companion of Hilda!"
</p></div></div>



<p>"Beautiful is he!" exclaimed Wulf. "But his face is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>full of pride this day, and I think he is in anger. Speak
not to him."</p>

<p>"The woman lifteth her veil," said Tostig, "and she
leaneth forward. Odin! She is wonderful! Her headdress
is of jewels. Mark the jarl!"</p>

<p>Dark yet fair, with the red of the new rose in her
cheeks and with eyes like the lone stars in a winter night,
was the young woman who so suddenly leaned forth to
look at Ulric. Into his eyes, also, came flashing a great
light and a smile of joy was on his face.</p>

<p>"O companion of Hilda!" he shouted in Hebrew.
"How camest thou hither from thy place among the
gods? I am Ulric the Jarl, and I saw thee when I was on
the sea."</p>

<p>Silent was this beautiful princess for a moment, but she
grew pale and then red and she seemed to tremble greatly.</p>

<p>"O maiden," said Ben Ezra, "whoever thou art, drive
on. He will not harm thee. He is a prince of the Saxons
and thou mayest not have conversation with him. He is
not for such as thou art, O daughter of Israel."</p>

<p>"Hold thou thy peace!" came from the maiden, as one
of high rank may speak. "Warrior of the Saxons, come
thou nearer. Thou didst not see me, for I was never on
any ship. What is thy meaning?"</p>

<p>Almost at the side of the chariot was the jarl, gazing
into her face, but his voice was as the murmur of a harp
in the wind when he replied to her.</p>

<p>"O beautiful one!" he said. "Princess of the light and
of the morning! More beautiful than are the flowers and
the stars! Thy face was where the gods live and I saw
thee in my dreams. I will give thee this token from
Ulric, of the sons of the gods."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>His hand had passed under the mail of his bosom and
the bag of gems was there. Now he drew out his hand
and he raised before the eyes of the Jewish maiden the
perfect gem of which Ben Ezra had said that it was priceless.</p>

<p>"He must not give her that," whispered Abbas.</p>

<p>"Hinder him not!" said Ben Ezra. "Little thou knowest
such as he. Wert thou to interfere now, thy head
were at the roadside before thou couldst breathe twice.
Leave it upon thy shoulders, madman!"</p>

<p>Abbas shrank back, clutching his fingers and scowling,
but the Jewish maiden's hand was already grasping the
jewel and her lips were smiling with a surpassing sweetness.</p>

<p>"I am Miriam," she said, "and I dwell in Jerusalem.
I shall see thee no more. But I give thee a ring for my
token. Never have I looked upon such a face as thine."</p>

<p>From her hand she took a ring, and in it was a large,
pure pearl, very brilliant, and the gold of the ring was
yellow and heavy.</p>

<p>"O Miriam," said Ulric, in the deep tones of the harp
of Oswald, "I will wear thy ring, but not in battle. I
come soon to Jerusalem, and I will meet thee there, or I
will meet thee in Asgard, among the gods, and I will take
thee to the house of my father, Odin. Thou art fit to be a
princess in Asgard."</p>

<p>His face was like the sun, but hers grew white again,
and she drew her veil over it, for Ben Ezra said to Ulric:</p>

<p>"Let none hear thee, O jarl. I know not this matter.
Thy words may bring upon her a peril. Harm her not,
but be prudent. Thou art a wise captain. Let her drive
on. Forward, charioteer! On thy life linger not!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou art right!" shouted back the brown man, nodding
his head at Ben Ezra. "She is my mistress, but she
is willful. On!"</p>

<p>The black charioteer slackened the reins of his prancing
horses and they sprang forward, but a great cry burst
from the lips of Miriam, and the word of Hebrew that
was in the sound of it was:</p>

<p>"Farewell, my beloved! I have seen thee!"</p>

<p>"Farewell, O princess!" but in the voice of Ulric, the
son of Brander, was a faintness of strong pain, and he
turned upon his heel, bowing his head.</p>

<p>"Speak not to the jarl!" said Tostig, grasping the arm
of Abbas. "What hast thou to do with an affair of a
warrior and a woman? Wert thou to meddle with me in
such a case, I would cleave thee to the jaws."</p>

<p>But the chariots all moved swiftly away, and so did the
horsemen who were with them, but none of these were
soldiers, and in the other chariots were but servants and
much baggage.</p>

<p>"The jarl hath marched on," said Tostig the Red.
"Follow and trouble him not; for that maiden was wonderfully
beautiful and she gave him a ring of remembrance."</p>

<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Passing of Oswald.</small></span></h2>


<p>The Northland under the autumn sun was as the
South, with green fields and forests and with glowing
blooms upon shrubbery and in the hollows of the hills.
The fiords were shadowy, with a coolness in the breezes
which breathed among them that was pleasant to the
wearied fishermen in returning boats.</p>

<p>Upon the high promontory looking seaward at the
north of the cove and of the village and of the house of
Brander there were no pine trees. Its bald granite knob
glittered in the waning light so that it might be seen from
far at sea as if it were a beacon. It was not a place for
men to seek having no errand to lead them, and not many
feet had trodden upon it since the world was made.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this place was not at the closing of the
day unoccupied, and from it there came a sound which
went out over the wide water, and downward that it
might mingle with the voices of the fiords, and landward,
also, that it might be joined with the soft sighing and low
whispering of the forests. Not loud was this sound at
the first, but it grew louder, and then with it went forth a
voice.</p>

<p>"I think my strength faileth me," said Oswald, the
harper, pausing in his song. "The harp was overheavy
to bring up the mountain. I grow old and I am alone.
Hilda sleepeth in the tomb of Odin's sons, Ulric is afar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
among unknown seas. Am I to die a cow's death before
he returneth? Who is there to make the mark of a spear
upon my breast, lest I fail of Valhalla? I have fought in
many a feast of swords. Why am I to perish slowly,
without honor? Sad is the fate of Oswald if the valkyrias
pass him and leave him to die in his bed."</p>

<p>Once more the song arose, but now his voice was
stronger and he sang of war to the rocks and to the trees
and to the gods among the fiords. The old gier-eagle on
the withered pine tree northward listened intently, now
and then fanning with his wide wings, until the spirit
that was in the harping awakened him well. Loud was
the scream that he sent back to Oswald, and he dropped
suddenly from the branch of the pine tree, spreading his
pinions and floating over the sea in a wide circle, rising as
he went.</p>

<p>"He is free to come and to go," mourned Oswald,
"but I am bound at home and I shall no more ride the war
steeds of the open sea nor hear the clang of shields nor
see the red blood flow. Where is the good ship <i>The
Sword</i> this day? Where are Ulric the Jarl and his
vikings?"</p>

<p>Low bowed his head and his hands sought fitfully the
strings of his harp, bringing out the notes of sorrow.</p>

<p>"I will arise," he said, "and I will go to Hilda's room.
I will play to her there and see if she will answer me.
She hath not spoken to me since her eyes were closed.
But she is with the gods and she hath many matters upon
her mind. She hath spoken to Brander the Brave and
to jarls and chiefs and kings that were of old. She hath
seen Odin, and she hath heard sagas that we hear not
until the return of the gods."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood erect upon the rock where he had been sitting,
and he was not weak, for he shouldered his great harp
and bore it with ease as he went down the rugged side
of the mountain. Many saw him come, and they who
were near enough greeted him, but he paused not to
speak. He went not through the village, among the
houses, but along the shore, where the tide was coming in
and where the waves called out to him as he passed. He
turned to listen to them, but across the water came no
other voice, and he shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"Here was <i>The Sword</i> launched," he said, halting at
the head of the cove. "Here was the White Horse of the
Saxons sacrificed to Odin. From hence the new keel
went out behind the outing ice. Hilda of the hundred
winters told me that there would be no return. Is it so?
Will the young jarl never again put his foot upon this
beach? Or did she speak only of the vessel? Who may
know the counsel of the gods! For they speak unto all
men in riddles and the meaning thereof is hidden from
us."</p>

<p>He turned and walked to the house, passing through
the great hall, bearing his harp, and he went on to the
room of Hilda, looking in.</p>

<p>"It is empty," he said. "No other hath slept therein
since she departed."</p>

<p>Bare were the walls, and the floor of cloven pine logs
lay black, uncovered by rushes. One small table only
remained, and upon this was a Roman lamp of bronze,
which Brander, the sea king, had brought back from one
of his voyages to Britain. There was oil in it and a wick,
for such had been a bidding of Hilda to one of the older
women and to the housemaidens. They feared much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
let that lamp go without filling, if the oil dried away; but
it had not been lighted, although a wick was in it.</p>

<p>"I will bring fire," said Oswald, and he did so, going
out and returning. He set the flame of his small torch
to the wick and it surprised him, for it would not burn.</p>

<p>"O Hilda," he exclaimed, "what is this thing that I
cannot light thy lamp?"</p>

<p>There was no spoken answer, but suddenly the wick
took the fire and it blazed up a handbreadth, as if for a
token.</p>

<p>"Burn thou, then," said Oswald. "I will sing to her."</p>

<p>Quickly they who were in the other rooms of the house
and in the hall heard the sound of harping and the voice
of a wonderful song, for it was as a love song sung to the
dead, telling her of the living and asking her concerning
the gods and of all the places of the gods, where she was
dwelling. Men and women listened, looking into one
another's faces and whispering low, for the song was
very beautiful and the harp answered as if it were
alive.</p>

<p>Joyously burned the lamp, with a clear golden flame,
as the song went on, but it at last burned lower and lower
and there came a red color into the fire.</p>

<p>"There hath been much blood!" exclaimed Oswald.
"I would I had been with the jarl in the feast of swords.
The battle is ended!"</p>

<p>For the lamp went out and the room was very dark,
but he sat in the gloom by his harp waiting for what
might come.</p>

<p>"Disturb him not," said all the household. "He ever
mourneth for Ulric and for Hilda."</p>

<p>Much time went by and now and then there came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
that room harp notes, one by one, very faint and low, but
Oswald was saying to himself:</p>

<p>"I have heard and I have not heard. All things are a
riddle that I cannot read. Surely she touched the harp
and her face was in the shadows. O Hilda, speak to me,
for I am lonely! Tell me that thou hast not forgotten
thy kindred!"</p>

<p>Then fell he down upon his face in a deep swoon, and
they who went in because they heard the sound found,
also, the harp lying by him with its strings broken. They
lifted him and carried him away, taking, also, the harp,
but when he again began to breathe and opened his eyes
the words that he first uttered were in another tongue
than that of the Northland. They heard the name of
Hilda, but even when he aroused himself and talked with
them he told them naught of what things had occurred
to him in the room of Hilda, the prophetess. For there
are secrets in the lives of men wherein other men have no
part, and no man openeth his hidden heart unwisely.
The thoughts of friends whose bodies are far apart are
often apt to draw near and to walk the earth side by side.
Oswald, indeed, was sending his heart out after Hilda
and after Ulric. If the saga woman had in any manner
answered him, no man knoweth. Nor can any say that
the soul of Ulric was nearer to that of Oswald because
both were thinking of each other and of her who had
departed from them.</p>

<p>So may the gods look on from their places and see
what men see not, and they may often smile, if they are
kindly minded, to see men and women meet and embrace
without the touching of the bodily flesh.</p>

<p>Three days went by, and because of a request of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Oswald's many messages had gone out from house to
house and from village to village, up and down the coast
and far inland. To everyone it was told that the hour
was at hand and that a token of the gods had come to
Oswald, but that he was still living. Upon the fourth
day all who were entitled to come, by reason of kinship
or of their high descent, had arrived. Many men and
many women had gathered, and among them were those
who brought harps. These sat apart and they spoke to
each other in low voices, tuning their harps and listening
to the sounds which answered them from the strings.</p>

<p>"The harp of Oswald is broken," said one. "Who shall
take it after him?"</p>

<p>"No man," replied the oldest of them all. "It is a
harp which came from the East, in the ship of a sea king,
and he gave it to the father of Oswald in the days when
Hilda was yet unborn. Upon it are strange runes that
none may read."</p>

<p>"It shall rest with him in his grave, then," said another,
"but Hilda said that he would need it not in the place to
which he hath gone."</p>

<p>"They have both harps and harpers there," said the old
man, thoughtfully. "I know not the meaning of Hilda's
word. So good a harp must find a player, and I think the
gods can mend it. We cannot, for we have no strings
like these."</p>

<p>Before them lay the great harp upon the floor of the
hall, and one lifted it, placing it before a chair as if it
might be played upon. There were yet three strings
remaining, and the old man sat down in the chair and
put out his hands, touching, also, the strings which were
broken. Not from these, assuredly, came the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
which now fell upon the ears of the gathered vikings, but
all were silent, for the spirit of song was upon this ancient
one whom no man knew. Clear was his voice, but thin,
and at times it wavered as if with age and weakness, but
he sang the departing song of Oswald and of the old time.
Strong were his hands also, for as he ceased he gripped
with them and these three strings, also, were snapped
asunder with loud twanging.</p>

<p>"Hilda is right!" he exclaimed. "The harp of Oswald
is dead. It will never sound again. Build ye a fire, high
and hot, and burn upon it this frame of wood. I go to
Oswald's room."</p>

<p>Rising from his chair, all saw that he was tall and
white-bearded, and none detained him while he went to
the room of Oswald.</p>

<p>"Thou art awakened, O Oswald, the harper?" he
asked, as he entered the room.</p>

<p>"Waiting for thee, old man," came hoarsely from the
lips of him who lay upon the bed. "Now lift me up that
I may stand erect, and put my sword in my hand. I will
not die a cow's death, and thou art mine enemy, having
full right in this matter."</p>

<p>"We burn thy harp, as Hilda gave thee directions,"
said the old man. "We bury thee in a coffin at the
foot of the great stone, thy arms and thy armor with
thee."</p>

<p>"Also my bag of coins," said Oswald, "and my cup of
silver. I know not if I may need them. They have
drinking horns in Valhalla. Smite me in the breast. Let
the spear mark be a deep one that I may be known as a
warrior."</p>

<p>In the doorway and within the room stood now chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and heroes and they had heard, and they said to the old
one, "Strike him!"</p>

<p>Deep and kindly was the thrust of the spear that was
given to Oswald, and he fell to the ground as if he had
fallen in battle, so that all the vikings were satisfied.</p>

<p>"Art thou to be smitten," asked a chief of the old man,
"or goest thou hence?"</p>

<p>"I am to see the earth put upon him," said the old man.
"I came far for this thing, from my place below the great
south fiord, toward Denmark. Ask me not my name lest
there be a blood revenge in the mind of some foolish one.
Take Oswald to his tomb and smite me there, for we are
to be buried together and my harp goeth with me."</p>

<p>All went out of the room and the bearers brought the
body of Oswald, the harpers playing and the women also
chanting. The ancient one took up his harp, which was
not very large, and he seemed joyful as he walked with
those who went forth to the place of tombs. The grave of
Oswald was deep and by it lay a coffin of cloven pine pieces.
In this they laid him, bending his swords and seax and
breaking the shaft of his spear. His shield and his mail
were broken and all were laid upon the body. Then one
placed the bag of coins and the goblet at the head and a
jarl of rank covered all with a slab of pine, throwing in
handfuls of earth and many stones.</p>

<p>"Art thou ready?" he asked of the old one.</p>

<p>"Not thy spear," he said. "Strike with thy sword; and
let it be a blow through the heart. As I cease this song
to the gods and to the dead I will lay my harp in the
tomb. Strike me then."</p>

<p>Now his voice failed him not and he sang well, bringing
loud music from his harp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have fought in fourscore of battles!" he shouted.
"I have sailed in all seas! I have spared none in the
feasts of swords! I have seen the red blood flow from
the hearts of many! I die by the hand of a jarl at the
grave of my old foeman. O Oswald, I shall be with thee
in Valhalla, and there will we cross our swords and fight
before the gods. Strike, thou of the sword!"</p>

<p>Down dropped his harp upon the coffin of Oswald and
the sword of the jarl passed through him, flashing and
returning. Then the ancient one lay upon his harp and
earth and stones were thrown in until the tomb was
filled and heaped. All the while the other harpers harped
and sang, so that due reverence was given to the passing
of Oswald.</p>

<p>"Will he see Hilda this night?" asked one of the
women. "I bade him greet her for me."</p>

<p>"They say that one who dieth must walk alone a little
distance," replied the other woman, "and then he cometh
to a dog; and he shall know then where to seek a house
that he may enter."</p>

<p>"I have heard many things," said the first speaker, "but
they do not agree. I think we know but little certainly.
It would be well if one of the dead were to come back and
say what he hath seen."</p>

<p>"I would rather hear a saga," said yet another of the
women. "I like not the dead. They are cold and they
bring ill fortune. Let them stay with the gods."</p>

<p>So said the greater part, but one woman went away
muttering to herself. "The dead! The dead!" she said.
"They are of no use to us after they are buried. They
care not for us any more. But I would willingly have
speech with one of them if he would not be overchurlish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
I will go, some night, and watch at the place of tombs.
The witches watch at tombs and they see wonders. But
it was worth seeing, the slaying of the old one. He was
a brave warrior and he died well."</p>

<p>There was a feast that night in the house of Brander
the Brave, for his kinsmen and his kinswomen entertained
their friends joyfully. There was much singing and
harping, and the horns and the cups came and went often
around the tables. They drank deeply to the success of
Ulric, the son of Brander, and to the voyage of his good
ship <i>The Sword</i>, and to his return in glory from doing
great deeds among the fleets of the Romans and among
the islands and cities of the Middle Sea.</p>

<p>"The jarl will come again!" they shouted. "And here
will he tell us of the feasts of swords and of the crashing
of ship against ship. Hael to Jarl Ulric! Hael!"</p>

<p>"Not in Samaria this night," had Lysias said to himself
when he rode away upon the swift ass whose ownership
might be questioned, "but there are many places by
the way wherein a wayfarer may find welcome if he
payeth."</p>

<p>Behind the saddle had been fastened the leathern sack
which he had brought with him from <i>The Sword</i>. It
contained changes of raiment, but little else, for his coins
and his jewels, which were not very valuable, were concealed
about his person. More than once as he rode on
he both thought and spoke concerning Ulric the Jarl and
the vikings, but always did he seem well pleased that he
was no longer in their company.</p>

<p>"The jarl is my sure friend," he remarked, "but some
of his tall comrades walk with a hand too near the hilt
of a sudden weapon."</p>

<p>It was toward the evening when, after riding through
towns and villages, he came to what was evidently a
caravansary of good size and cleanly keeping at the
roadside.</p>

<p>"Here will I halt," he said. "I am now far escaped
from burning wrecks and hasty-tempered pirates. I will
have this beast of mine well cared for. He showeth no
weariness. I think&mdash;O ye gods! I know&mdash;I am nearer
my Sapphira!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Ere he could dismount, however, before him stood the
keeper of the hostelry. Such as he are ever ready to greet
with smiling faces the well appareled, riding beasts of
price. "He will have money to pay with," thought the
innkeeper. "But the land swarmeth with Greeks."</p>

<p>Loud and friendly was his greeting, and in a moment
more he was made to understand that this elegant
stranger was Lysias, the student, returning to Jerusalem
to the school of Gamaliel from a journey to the Lebanon
and to the cities of Galilee. Being a man of Samaria, the
keeper was the better pleased that his guest was not a
Jew, for of them he spoke with scorn and hatred.</p>

<p>"O youth," he said, as they went into the inn, "thou
art fortunate. Thou abidest with me this night and on
the morrow thy journey will have goodly companionship.
There is here a company from Bethsaida and from other
cities near the sea of Tiberias. They are merchants, and
among them are a taxgatherer and one who dealeth in
slaves. There is neither scribe nor Levite to make thee
uncomfortable with his evil speech. May they all perish!
It is said that the roads are not entirely safe and the
robbers come and go without warning."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of them," said Lysias, "but I think this
village must be safe, for I saw the helmet of a legionary
as I rode in."</p>

<p>"Where they are the robbers come not," said the
keeper, "but they will not be with thee always on the
road."</p>

<p>Then walked he away, and Lysias overheard him muttering
curses upon all Romans and contempt for all
Greeks.</p>

<p>"I think I heard somewhat else," thought Lysias, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
I will look well at this company with which I am to
journey to Jerusalem. There have been innkeepers who
had no enemies among the robbers and there have been
robbers who paid tribute to all innkeepers. I may not
carry a bow, but mine eyes and mine ears may do me
good service."</p>

<p>Very good was the entertainment given to him and to
his comely brown beast, but the departure was early the
next morning. Even more in number than he had expected
were these who came out into the road at the door
of the inn to go on together.</p>

<p>"They are of many kinds," thought Lysias. "No
twain are alike. I will not have much conversation with
them, but I will watch, for I think they know this innkeeper
exceedingly well."</p>

<p>So did he, and it was late in the day when he halted
upon the summit of a hill, looking thoughtfully forward
and then behind him.</p>

<p>"O ass," he said, "how fast canst thou gallop if it is
to save thy master's throat from cutting? Thou hast
robbers for companions, and they do but await their
opportunity, which I have not yet given them by the
way."</p>

<p>The ass did but pull at the bit and the rein was loosened
that he might go. On the northerly slope of that hill,
however, the company of men and animals which had
seemed but peaceful at the outset had halted for a rest
before ascending the steep. There were now Jews among
them, and others of whose race and lineage there might
be curious questioning. Now, also, there were weapons
to be seen, such as privileged merchants might be allowed
to carry for their protection, and no doubt they had with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
them written authority to show to any Roman officer.
At the first there had been but a dozen men and the
women who were with them, but more had joined at a
hamlet upon this side of the city of Samaria, now far
behind them. Of these latter was an exceedingly black-browed
man, having but one eye, and he seemed to be a
sort of leader and commander over the others. To Lysias
he had averred that he was a dealer in cattle, having a
contract with the purveyors of the Roman garrisons.
Thus far he had purchased no beasts, but he had looked
covetously at the fine ass which carried the young Greek.
At this hour he was saying to another of his crew:</p>

<p>"To-night, then. He hath treasure with him, and the
beast will bear me swiftly to the wilderness. We will
throw his carcass into the pit near the three palms at the
crossroad. None will be the wiser and his friends will
in vain make inquiry."</p>

<p>"I will stab him as he sleepeth," replied the man spoken
to. "The Romans care little if there be one Greek the less.
We will speak softly to him when we catch up with him.
I have seen that he hath no manner of unquiet mind as
to us."</p>

<p>On went the ass, however, at his swiftest pace, even
while they were talking, and a long league of the highway
did he pass before the intending stabber rode over
the crest of that hill.</p>

<p>"Where is the Greek?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Ridden on a little," replied the evil-faced captain.
"Pursue not, lest thou alarm him. He will wait for us.
He liketh well to prove the speed of his fine beast."</p>

<p>He had not spoken untruly, for Lysias was gladly discovering
for the first time that he had found a treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
with four legs, a swift and tireless runner that took pleasure
in a race, needing no urging. Only in hamlets and
villages, of which there were many, was the rein drawn,
and wayfarers who greeted the rider received but brief
responses.</p>

<p>"Here am I safe!" he exclaimed at last, "for yonder
on the hill is a fort and near it is a camp of Romans. My
thieves are no longer a peril. Glad am I, too, that I am so
far from the Saxon jarl and his pirates. Their short,
sharp blades are ever too near even to each other, and a
spear in the hand of a Saxon is but an eager hunter
seeking for a mark. I will rest here, and then I will let
this beast shorten the road to Jerusalem."</p>

<p>They who had proposed to take the swift ass from him
had also hastened somewhat until they inquired carefully
of one whom they met, describing Lysias and his bearer.</p>

<p>"Yea," said the man, "ye mean the hasty messenger.
He passed me going like the wind. He who sent the
message may be sure of its speedy delivery."</p>

<p>Loud and fierce were the utterances of the evil-faced
one and his companions, and they cursed their gods for
this disappointment. Also they blamed themselves much
that they had not sooner taken courage to slay the Greek.
It was for this, their cowardice and delay, they said, that
the gods had mocked them.</p>

<p>"Never again," said the evil-faced one, "will I throw
away a gift that they have placed in my hand. But they
might have allowed me the chance I had chosen this
night. I have but small confidence in the gods. They are
treacherous."</p>

<p>Strong and well made was the Roman camp at the foot
of the hill whereon was the castle. There were intrench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>ments
and a mound and lines of palisades, and before
these there was drawn up a full cohort of legionaries. It
was an evening parade, and along the glittering line there
rode without companions an eagle-faced man, who wore
no armor.</p>

<p>"Half drilled!" he muttered, angrily. "It is well we
are at peace. Of what good were such as these upon the
Parthian frontier? Julius Cæsar would never have
beaten the Nervii with these dwarfs to face the stout
barbarians. He would but have left them to rot in the
wilderness, as Crassus did his Syrian levies. But I think
I can teach these fellows that they cannot trifle with
Pontius the Spearman."</p>

<p>Backward and all around the cohort rode the wrathful
procurator of Judea, addressing no man, and then he
wheeled and rode out to the highway.</p>

<p>"O thou upon the swift ass!" he suddenly shouted.
"Come hither! I require thee."</p>

<p>Bowing low, but answering not, Lysias obeyed him,
awaiting further speech.</p>

<p>"Is thy beast as swift as he seemeth?" said Pontius.
"I know a good beast. Is he tired?"</p>

<p>"Never saw I one as swift," said Lysias. "But at the
close of a day he were better for a rest."</p>

<p>"He may have a short one," said the Roman general,
wisely. "I prepare a message that will take thy head with
it if it be not delivered rightly. I have naught here but
clumsy beasts that travel a league a day."</p>

<p>Then he turned to summon a servant, to whom he gave
direction and with whom Lysias rode into the camp,
wondering much at his good fortune at such an hour.</p>

<p>"This is of Mercurius," he thought. "I have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
thought well of him, and my father was once a priest of
his temple at Corinth; the god hath now remembered me.
To him I owe my prosperity upon this journey, and he
did not favor the thieves as is his wont."</p>

<p>The ass had been hard ridden, but seemed not much the
worse for it. Water and grain were brought to him, and
Lysias, also, ate and drank. More time went by than he
had expected before a soldier came to summon him to
the camp gate.</p>

<p>"Saddle and mount!" said the soldier. "The hand of
the procurator is heavy."</p>

<p>No answer might be made except to obey, and shortly
the young Greek was at the gate.</p>

<p>"Kill not thy beast, lest thou fail of thy errand," said
the eagle-faced commander. "Take thou this letter to the
captain of the Damascus gate at Jerusalem. This also,
and this. He will further deliver them. Abide thou with
him until he give thee answers. Bring them to me."</p>

<p>Few and brief had been his questionings of the young
Greek, the pupil of Gamaliel. He was but a tool, an
instrument, intelligent, sufficient, sure to serve well
because of the scourge or the sword, or of reward. So
rule the Romans, and they who receive orders from a
Roman general hesitate not to obey.</p>

<p>Silently sat Lysias until the procurator ceased speaking
and motioned with his hand. Then, as if of his own
accord, the ass went forward. Therefore Lysias had
become a royal messenger, whom all men would be eager
to speed upon his way, for the fear of Pontius went with
him.</p>

<p>"Mercurius!" he shouted, at a goodly distance from
the camp. "Better to me art thou than is Jupiter. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
may Venus, also, be my aid if it be true that my Sapphira
was sold into the household of this bloody one. O that I
might send an arrow into his heart and a flame into his
dwelling! But I will not fail of the due delivery of his
messages. Who knoweth to what the gods may have
destined me? Soon will all the Saxons perish and no
man then will know the manner of my coming into Syria.
Sapphira! Sapphira! O swift beast! O Venus, goddess
of love! Let me go on to Jerusalem that I may once more
look into her eyes and hear her voice and touch her hand.
She shall not be for another, but for me, for the gods have
favored me greatly!"</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Cunning of Julius.</small></span></h2>


<p>"O Jew, thou hast brought to Tiberias the gladiators
of Caius of Thessalonica! Woe to thee and to thy
accursed race! But I have orders concerning thee and
these. They will give us fine sport before long."</p>

<p>Low bowed Ben Ezra to the Roman officer of the gate
and his reverent reply came not fully to the ears of Ulric;
but the jarl's face flushed haughtily, for he liked neither
the speech nor the manner of the Roman. The Saxons,
also, were watching their jarl and their faces also reddened,
the hands of men tightening upon the shafts of
their spears.</p>

<p>"He will be prudent," they said, "but we are not slaves,
to be trodden on. As he doeth so will we."</p>

<p>Unto him now the officer turned as if he were looking
at some newly caught wild beast.</p>

<p>"O Saxon," he said, "I have heard of thee. Thou
didst well by the robbers, but they cost thy Caius of
Thessalonica a tall swordsman. Now thou art to be
made food for a lion. I shall see thee torn in the circus
shortly, please the gods."</p>

<p>With an effort did the jarl steady his temper, but there
was a deepness in his voice:</p>

<p>"O Roman, I shall be ready for thy lion. But if thou
hast anything further to say thou mayest say it to Caius
of Thessalonica. He is a man and he will answer thee."</p>

<p>"What care I for him?" exclaimed the officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"He will answer thee that thing also," said the jarl.
"It is between thee and him. I have no words with one
who openeth and shutteth a gate."</p>

<p>"I will have thee scourged."</p>

<p>"Silence!" ordered a stern, hard voice behind him.
"Thou forgettest thyself, Demetrius, of the gate. The
scourging of gladiators is not with thee. O Saxon, thy
answer is good. March on to thy quarters."</p>

<p>"O noble Julius, the centurion," replied Ulric, "thy
tower was a fair abiding place, and thou wert correct in
providing it with a garrison."</p>

<p>The face of Julius flushed somewhat, for the jarl spoke
to him as one captain may to another.</p>

<p>"I have an account of that affair," he said. "Keep thou
thy speech to thyself. Thou hast but slain a few robbers."</p>

<p>"I have heard of thee," said the jarl, "that thou art
thyself a good fighter and entitled to the respect of the
brave. Thou hast led a legion to victory in a hard battle.
Well with thee!"</p>

<p>There is vanity in all men, and the anger passed from
Julius while the haughty mannered jarl of the Saxons
ascribed to him this fame.</p>

<p>"I have fought more fights than ever thou hast," he
said. "But thou art a seaman. I would put thee upon a
ship if I had one."</p>

<p>"I am of the sea kings," said Ulric, "but yonder water
is too small for a great battle. It is but a fishing pond."</p>

<p>The ground upon which they stood was the high and
difficult hill which ariseth behind the city. This, with
its palace gardens, was more than two leagues in circuit
if the wall were measured around it from a point on the
south shore to a point on the north shore. But part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
this distance was of crags crowned with forts, and much
of the city was a suburb, having no wall. Within were
temples and great buildings, and there was an amphitheater
near the shore. The Saxons had wondered at the
beauty and grandeur of this place as they drew near.
They had marched by way of small towns and villages,
but up to this hour never before had one of them seen
such a city as Tiberias or such a lake as Galilee.</p>

<p>"Speak no more," said Ben Ezra, "but obey him and
march on. Our quarters are in the lower town, near
the circus. He giveth orders to the guards at the
gate."</p>

<p>Forward strode Ulric, followed by his men, and Julius
glanced after them. "Caius hath beaten me," he muttered.
"I have none to contend with these. They must
be destroyed by tigers and lions. I will not waste an
elephant upon them."</p>

<p>Once they were within the wall they could obtain from
that height a fair view of the city, and they halted as one
man.</p>

<p>"O Jew," said Tostig the Red, "is thy Jerusalem larger
and better than this?"</p>

<p>"An hundredfold!" exclaimed Ben Ezra. "This
abomination of the heathen is but as a handful compared
with Zion, the city of Jehovah, God of Hosts."</p>

<p>"Then, O jarl," said Tostig, "I will not get myself
killed until I have seen Jerusalem. Manage thou with
care, for I think thou wouldst like to see it thyself."</p>

<p>"So will I," replied Ulric. "But I think we shall suffer
no harm in this place. I have not seen any strong men
yet except some of these Jews, who do not carry arms.
They would make good fighting men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>For he had looked at all whom he met with the eye of
a captain, and the rabble of that land did not please
him.</p>

<p>"Thou art right," said Ben Ezra. "Thou hast seen
men of the tribe of Zebulun and of the tribe of Naphtali
and some of Ephraim and Manasseh. They are swordsmen
if they had a king. Ere long our king cometh. But
these heathen of Tiberias are fit only to be crushed under
the foot like vipers."</p>

<p>"Speak not so loudly," said Abbas at his side. "Remember
that thou art a Jew, and they hate thee."</p>

<p>"O thou of a weak heart!" exclaimed Ben Ezra.
"When shall a money-lender be fit to wear a sword!
Knowest thou not that I can lead these Saxons through
a host of these dogs of the gentiles? The Romans are
warriors, but the rabble of Tiberias are scorned even by
the lepers. Let us go on."</p>

<p>Fierce was the countenance of the Jew as they went
down the long street, for it was broad and on either side
of it were temples and shrines.</p>

<p>"Pollution! Abomination!" he exclaimed. "O jarl
of the Saxons, these gods of Tiberias are but of wood
and stone, the work of men's hands. This place is cursed
because of them."</p>

<p>"I will inquire shortly of what sort they may be," said
Ulric. "I grow curious concerning gods. What need
of so many? They would all go down before the hammer
of Thor. Where is thy god that he permitteth them to
be here?"</p>

<p>"This was never a city of my people," said Ben Ezra.
"It is a work of the Greeks and the Romans. In Jerusalem
thou wilt see only the temple of the living god, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of him thou wilt find no image in stone or wood or metal.
No man hath ever seen his face."</p>

<p>"I like that," said Ulric, striding onward. "There
would be harm if the gods were seen too often. I will
yet look again into the face of one, but I am of their
kindred and Odin is my father. Thy god seemeth a good
one."</p>

<p>All the while the other Saxons gazed as they went,
saying not much, but wondering, and all who met them
stepped aside, for their stature was great and their arms
were splendid. The jarl had bidden them prepare for
this on the previous day, and Julius and the gate guards
had seen Northmen appareled and armored as if they
were now marching to a feast of swords.</p>

<p>Behind them now came on their baggage chariot, and
shortly it was joined by horsemen, servants of Caius, sent
by him to care for the guidance and welfare of his
gladiators.</p>

<p>Before a palace in the main street of the city, well
down toward the sea, sat upon their horses two horsemen
from whom others reined aside respectfully. These were
face to face and they had greeted one another with all
ceremony.</p>

<p>"Thy northern wolves have arrived, O Caius," said
one. "But thou art short of a tall fighter."</p>

<p>"So art thou robbed of thy robbers, O Julius," replied
the friend of Ulric. "Thy tower was a subtle trap, but
it hath not profited thee greatly."</p>

<p>"Ha!" responded Julius, mockingly. "Thou hast lost
thy best sword. A thousand sesterces that my Numidian
lion slayeth thy Saxon chief."</p>

<p>"Wagered!" exclaimed Caius. "And a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
sesterces more that thy Hyrcanian tiger shall also be slain
by the man I will name against him."</p>

<p>"I have thee!" shouted Julius. "We will write these
wagers with care and let thy words be recorded with
exactness. If either the lion or the tiger shall be slain
by a Saxon, I lose that wager, but if a Saxon be overcome
by the tiger or the lion, thou losest."</p>

<p>"Thou hast some cunning of thine own in this," laughed
Caius, "but thy sesterces and mine will be in the keeping
of Sempronius, the judge of the games. I will trust him."</p>

<p>Each of these carried a tablet of wax and a pointed
stylus of steel wherewith they wrote, and the words were
compared with care, that they might then be written upon
parchments, to be held by the judge of the games.</p>

<p>"What meaneth he?" thought Caius as he rode away
from the gate. "I will see the Jew, Ben Ezra, as to this
matter. There is a trap. I have not yet seen the laws
of this circus, and Julius knoweth them well."</p>

<p>Like an inn, large and well appointed, was the house
to which the Saxons were guided, near the circus, and
they entered it gladly, for they were as men who were
walking on into a new world.</p>

<p>"O Abbas," said Ben Ezra, "come with me to the
amphitheater. I would inquire there concerning many
things."</p>

<p>"Not so," replied Abbas. "Go thou. I have a friend
to commune with and I go to meet him."</p>

<p>"O jarl of the Saxons," said Ben Ezra, as Abbas
departed, "it is well that he goeth not with us. Come!
Trust him not. He is overfond of money. Thou art a
soldier. Thou must see thine enemy. Speak not to any
man, but hear well. Who here knoweth thy gift of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
tongues? I am thine interpreter, and be thou as if thou
wert deaf."</p>

<p>Ulric did but bow his head in answer to Ben Ezra,
but the other Saxons knew the errand of their jarl and
approved of his going.</p>

<p>A high arch of marble was the gate of the amphitheater,
and on one side of it, upon the wall, was a broad
tablet of wood. Upon this were inscribed many things,
and both Ben Ezra and the jarl read them.</p>

<p>"Speak not," said the Jew. "One cometh to lead us
to the dens."</p>

<p>Through the portal they went, guided by a soldier of
Julius, and he seemed pleased to show them all things.
First went they across the arena, and this was a broad
place, egg-shaped, with vast tiers of seats arising upon all
sides. Under these tiers were the keeping places, and
from some of these came cries and roarings of wild beasts
and the shouts of men.</p>

<p>"Here are the prisons of criminals and of captured
rebels," said the soldier as the guard before a door opened
it to let them in, "but thou hast little to do with these.
They are to slay each other or to be torn by beasts.
There are trained swordsmen for thee and thine."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he and the jarl and the Jew went into
more than one of these prisons, looking well at what they
found there.</p>

<p>"Wretches!" murmured Ulric. "Some of them hardly
seem like men and women. It is well for such as they
are to be slain quickly. The gods care not for these
people, and so they are given to the Romans."</p>

<p>Not so thought Ben Ezra, for he beat his breast more
than once and he whispered to himself in Hebrew:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"O God of Israel!" he gasped. "Here are of thine own
chosen people, also, many scores, taken in the snares of
the heathen. Where art thou, O Jehovah, that thou
hearest not? Canst thou not see this city of pollution,
wherein thy name hath not been written? Unclean!
Unclean! Woe is me that I am here! It is as Sodom
and Gomorrah, and thy fire lingereth!"</p>

<p>What he meant Ulric understood only in part, but he
saw that many of these who were doomed were Jews.</p>

<p>"They are not warriors," he thought, "except that
some of them are tall and strong. They must all die and
get out of these prisons, but they go not to Valhalla, and
I know not where they go. I care not to slay such
persons."</p>

<p>Now the guard led him and his interpreter to the dens
of the animals and Ulric was displeased that his men were
not with him to see.</p>

<p>"The wolves," he said in Saxon, "are like those of the
North. I think not much of the hyenas, nor of the small
leopards. The great leopards are fierce beasts and so are
the bears, but I could meet one of them."</p>

<p>There were four elephants in one den, and he walked
around among them, wondering at their size and at their
peacefulness, while Ben Ezra told him of their intelligence
and of their manner of fighting.</p>

<p>The jarl did but study them thoughtfully, and now a
keeper said to Ben Ezra:</p>

<p>"It is known by us that this Saxon is to fight the great
lion. Come."</p>

<p>The den was near and in it the lion was pacing to and
fro.</p>

<p>"He is almost as large in body as was the ice bear,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
thought Ulric. "He standeth higher and his head is vast.
He is a springing beast. He is stronger than the one we
saw in Africa. I think he would fail if his heart were
cloven. Now I will see the tiger."</p>

<p>Near was his den also, and he, too, walked to and fro,
snarling fiercely, for he was hungry.</p>

<p>"O Abbas," said the keeper of the beasts to Ben Ezra,
mistaking him, "thou art for Julius in this matter. What
thinkest thou of thy Saxon? If he can meet a lion, can
he fight, also, the tiger? How will he not be rent quickly
when both are let loose upon him!"</p>

<p>"Silence, thou unwise one!" said Ben Ezra. "Is it for
thee to let out this tiger?"</p>

<p>"That is my care," said the keeper. "I stand in this
small box to throw open the door, and the tiger will be
famished on the day of the games."</p>

<p>"Mark thou this thine instruction!" said Ben Ezra.
"Wait thou not! Send out thy tiger when thou hearest
the trumpet call for the lion. So shall Julius win two
thousand sesterces. Hold not thy door till the lion be
slain, lest thou be smitten with a sword. Thy life for it!
The beasts go out together."</p>

<p>Ulric heard and he understood, for a fire flashed in his
eyes, but he held his tongue. "I am to be torn without
hope!" he thought. "I am betrayed by Abbas, but I
know the thing in the mind of Ben Ezra. He doeth
cunningly."</p>

<p>So they walked on across the arena, and as they went
Ben Ezra stood still.</p>

<p>"Here," he said in Saxon, "wilt thou halt if thou art
wise. Thou wilt have thy mail on, but only thy sword
and thy shield."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will wear no armor!" said Ulric. "I will bear no
weights. What were mail and shield against these
monsters? I will bring with me the long sword of Annibaal.
Odin be with me! He who fighteth a lion must
spring as lightly as doth a lion. He who faceth a tiger
must move as the lightning or he is lost."</p>

<p>"Thou art wise!" exclaimed the Jew. "I have seen
no warrior like thee. Verily I am true to thee. Sharpen
thy sword and let thy hand and thy heart be strong. I
would that Jehovah of Hosts might fight for thee, but
thou art a heathen and thou must look to thine own gods,
if so be they can do anything in such a case."</p>

<p>Dark was the face of the Jew, but he said no more, and
they went back to the house of the gladiators.</p>

<p>Eager were all the Saxons to hear the account of their
jarl, and he told them many things, but in the gloom of
the evening Caius came and he spoke to Tostig the Red.</p>

<p>"Thou art to meet a black giant with a net and a trident
against thy sword and shield," he said. "What thinkest
thou, O Saxon? Am I safe to wager upon thy success?"</p>

<p>It was Abbas who interpreted, but the men had already
heard much of these nets and tridents and Tostig stood
still for a moment.</p>

<p>"I have not seen this giant, O Roman captain," he said.
"May I be guided by my own jarl?"</p>

<p>"Verily!" exclaimed Caius. "Do thou as he will tell
thee, and I know not what it is. O jarl, can he win?"</p>

<p>"I saw thy giant," said Ulric. "Tostig the Red will
slay him for thee. Make thy wagers. I would talk with
Abbas."</p>

<p>"So do!" said Caius, for Ben Ezra had beckoned him
and he stepped away a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Abbas of the jarl.</p>

<p>"Only this," said Ulric. "I have seen the lion of Julius.
He is a great one. Hath he slain many?"</p>

<p>"That I know not," said Abbas. "Why askest thou?
What matters it to thee?"</p>

<p>"Little," said Ulric, "but I was curious," and he asked
him other questions, keeping him while Ben Ezra talked
with Caius, getting full permission that the jarl should
wear arms of his own choosing and not the armor of a
Roman soldier.</p>

<p>Caius rode away and many great ones came and went,
as they had been doing; for they who were to make
wagers willed to see these pirates of Caius, as they called
them. Not any, it seemed, went away believing that the
jarl could face the Numidian, and they declared that
Julius would win his wager.</p>

<p>Then the night passed and in the early dawn Ulric, the
son of Brander, sat apart by himself sharpening the long,
beautiful sword on the stone which Wulf the Skater had
brought to him from the North Cape, at the end of the
world. To him came then Ben Ezra, looking like one
whose soul is burdened within him.</p>

<p>"O jarl," he said, "the great games are set down for the
third day hence. Wilt thou then be rested after thy
journeying?"</p>

<p>"Were I to meet the lion this day," replied Ulric, "I
am not weary. I care more for the training of Tostig
the Red in the matter of this black giant. I pray thee
procure for me a net and trident that the thing he is to
do may not be altogether new to him."</p>

<p>"That will I do," said Ben Ezra, "but thou canst not
instruct thyself concerning lions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the close of that day the jarl and Tostig were
in a room by themselves, but they told not to any man
what they did with these strange weapons whereby so
many good swordsmen had been destroyed. That day,
moreover, and the next day and the next the Saxons wandered
much around the city of Tiberias, for they were
permitted to do so freely, and all the people wondered at
their stature and their armor.</p>

<p>"What thinkest thou of all these temples?" asked Wulf
the Skater of Ulric. "Would it not be well for thee and
Tostig to offer sacrifices to some of these gods?"</p>

<p>"What good?" said the jarl. "I know them not and
they know not me. I would sacrifice to Jehovah if he had
an altar here, because he is the god of all this land. I
heard Jesus of Nazareth praying to him and calling him
his father. If Jesus were here I would ask him that
Jehovah might be to me instead of Odin, for I think the
North gods are far away. Caius may sacrifice to his
Roman gods if he will, but thou and I have no business
with them."</p>

<p>"Thou art wise, O jarl," said Wulf. "I will waste
none of my coins upon these priests and temples."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Lion and the Tiger.</small></span></h2>


<p>Splendid was the appearance of the Saxons on the
morning of the great day of the games at Tiberias, when
they marched around the arena with the jarl at their
head, for their arms and armor were bright and their
bearing was that of warriors accustomed to conquer.
They themselves gazed, wondering, as they went, at the
throngs which crowded the rising tiers of seats. Among
these were many in gorgeous apparel, and the rich women
had vied with each other in the colors and shapes of their
garments and in the gold and jewels of their tiaras and
other ornaments. There was a place on a lower tier for
all the free gladiators, and to this the Saxons went after
their marching. In it was a covered stairway going down
to the door by which any among them might enter a
room adjoining the arena to wait for his summons to
combat. Each company of the trained ones was by itself
and they were not too near each other.</p>

<p>Julius and Caius and other great men, with their glittering
women, had a place which was as if it were full of
thrones, but in the center of this was one splendid chair
in which only a Cæsar or a proconsul might at any time
presume to sit. It was this day unoccupied, but against
it leaned the eagle standard of a legion and before it were
scattered flowers.</p>

<p>The games began with races, both of footmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
chariots, and in these the multitude were interested greatly,
but only they who had wagers cared much who might
win.</p>

<p>When these were over it was time for the shedding
of blood, and a band of captives were driven in, knowing
that their fate had come.</p>

<p>"I see no swordsmen," was in the mind of Ulric.
"Each of these hath a dart, but he is naked and so are
the women and children."</p>

<p>Then uttered he a loud exclamation, for a door under
the tiers of seats swung open widely and the den behind
it vomited wolves famished with hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>"So many!" said Ulric. "Where got they so many?
This is the cruelty of the Romans. I see no sport in this
thing. It is but tearing and shrieking, for the small darts
avail not."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many wolves were slain before all the
captives were torn down. Men in full armor went out to
drive the rest of the beasts back to their den, but it was
not difficult, for hunger was satiated and a wolf might
carry with him a torn limb or a fragment of raw flesh.</p>

<p>Swiftly a crowd of bondservants cleansed the arena,
and the feast of the wolves had not been long in duration.</p>

<p>"There cometh now thy giant with the net and trident,"
said Ulric to Tostig. "He is very black. He is
from Africa. Watch him well, for this thing of his is
but a trick of skill. Thou couldst parry that three-pronged
spear?"</p>

<p>"That can I," said Tostig. "But the net? Let us see
what he doeth with that short-legged brown swordsman
in mail and helmet."</p>

<p>Brave seemed to be the brown warrior, but the net flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
over him and the negro stepped backward, dragging.
Then it was but as a flash and the trident was driven
deeply through mail and breast.</p>

<p>Loud were the plaudits of the multitude, for the pitiless
black had seemed to show both skill and strength.</p>

<p>The next comer was a large man, and Ben Ezra, sitting
near Ulric, ground his teeth.</p>

<p>"A warrior of Israel, from the Lebanon!" he exclaimed.
"He will but be netted!"</p>

<p>"Watch!" whispered Ulric to Tostig. "Thy turn
cometh next. Mark how he faileth and remember what
I taught thee."</p>

<p>"I see his sleight of hand," said Tostig. "I have beaten
harder fighters than he is. The Jew is snared!"</p>

<p>Longer this time had been the contest, for the Jew ran,
dodging, advancing, retreating, striking, and it was only
by his utmost skill that the huge African at last threw
over him the fatal net. Even then the trident was parried
oft, but it struck and the brave Jew went down.</p>

<p>"Now!" said Ulric to Tostig. "I go with thee. We
will show them a thing. Let me see thy seax. It is sharp.
It will do. Off with thy armor! Take this heavy shield
and see that thou cast it well."</p>

<p>Bare, save a cloth around his loins and a helmet on his
head, Tostig went out into the arena, and the multitude
shouted loudly, but Julius bit his lip. "Here is something
more than the Nubian hath yet encountered," he muttered.
"I would I might change my wagers. Yonder
Saxon is an athlete for the Olympian games."</p>

<p>Well used were the rabble of Tiberias, however, to see
their black favorite net his victims. Neither they nor he
expected aught but a sure and speedy victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Facing each other at twenty cubits' distance were now
the two combatants, and on the face of Tostig the Red
was a smile.</p>

<p>"Now do I see more plainly the meaning of the jarl!"
he exclaimed. "Let this black one but cast his net. Thor
and Odin! What a simple trick is this to be slain
by!"</p>

<p>The black uttered a great cry, laughing, as he strode
forward, but Tostig made no retreat. He did but stamp
with one foot, balancing himself, and loosened the exceedingly
heavy shield upon his left arm, to seize it, also,
with his right hand.</p>

<p>Through the air swept the net of peril, whistling as it
went, and flying, with a wide hollowing, to fall over
Tostig as it had fallen over many another. Laughed,
also, Tostig, throwing with all his strength, and midway
in the air the heavy shield struck into the hollow of the
net, swinging it suddenly downward, but it fell also over
the points of the lowered trident, tangling it. Around
and under the tangle, not touched by it, went the white
and muscular shape of the Saxon and the swift seax went
twice into the bosom of the African juggler with nets.</p>

<p>"Thy sesterces, O Julius!" shouted Caius. "Thy
favorite is gone from thee. What thinkest thou of my
Saxons?"</p>

<p>True gamester was Julius, for his face changed not its
proud serenity.</p>

<p>"I have but learned how a strong swordsman may
overcome the weapons of Neptune," he responded. "My
lion will bring me back my sesterces."</p>

<p>"Well for thee, O jarl!" muttered Caius. "My Saxons
have a cunning captain. He is a man to win battles. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
must keep him. But great is his peril now. Jove guard
him lest I lose many sesterces."</p>

<p>The multitude was hoarse with shouting, and now they
grew silent, for they knew by the lists that they were
next to see a trained swordsman torn asunder by the
unconquerable lion from Numidia, the beast which had
slain heroes before Cæsar.</p>

<p>The trumpet had not yet sounded when Ulric, the son
of Brander, went down the stairway to the room below
where waited for him the master of the games, and upon
this man's face was a bitter smile, for he was a servant of
Julius.</p>

<p>"O Saxon," he said, "the edict forbiddeth thee to wear
mail. Thou hast but a sword and buckler. The lion
weareth no armor."</p>

<p>"Ulric the Jarl," exclaimed Wulf the Skater, "this is
a trick for thy destruction!"</p>

<p>"Wait thou, true friend," said the jarl. "Trust me yet
a little. Odin is with me this day, and fear not thou these
tricksters."</p>

<p>The master of the games understood not the Saxon
tongue, but he read well the fierce eyes of Wulf and
he fell back a little, for the Skater's hand was on his
sword-hilt and the Saxons were known to act suddenly.</p>

<p>"No helmet!" said the cunning friend of Julius. "The
lion fighteth bareheaded."</p>

<p>The sword of Wulf rattled loosely in the sheath as the
helmet was put aside, but he obeyed a sign from Ulric
and drew it not.</p>

<p>"If the jarl be slain," he muttered, "that dog must die.
I will see to this matter."</p>

<p>Knud the Bear had come down, but he was silent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
his face was dark. He and Wulf turned and went up the
stairs and so did the master of the games, well satisfied.</p>

<p>"Now the long sword!" said Ulric, throwing aside the
short falchion provided for him. "O but its edge is
keen!"</p>

<p>He heard the trumpet sound and the door before him
opened. Then the great multitude shouted with admiration
and the Saxons themselves wondered.</p>

<p>"He is so beautiful!" exclaimed Tostig the Red. "O
that we must lose him! What shall we do without our
jarl?"</p>

<p>"Would that I might die with him!" groaned Wulf
the Skater, but Knud was thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Do we not know him?" he said. "Is he not the son
of Odin? Are all our gods dead? I think the Nornir are
not here and that the valkyrias will not come."</p>

<p>A tower of white stood the jarl, with but a silken garment
from waist to knee, and his golden-curled head was
a glory. In his hand was the African sword, its bright
blade and the jewels of its hilt glittering.</p>

<p>"It is not the sword I sent him," muttered Julius.
"That might have broken in his hand, but this will not.
He is like Mars! O Caius, what thinkest thou of thy
barbarian and of thy sesterces?"</p>

<p>"Wilt thou double thy wager?" asked Caius. "I am
pleased with my Saxon lion."</p>

<p>"Nay," laughed Julius, "thou wilt have losses enough.
Thou wilt see him torn shortly."</p>

<p>For the trumpet spoke again and the lion sprang out
of his cage with a roar like distant thunder. The sun
rays fell upon his face, however, and he lifted his head,
blinded for a moment. Then he saw the throng and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
walked along a few paces, as if willing to spring among
the tiers of seats, but they were high and he looked again
around the arena. Motionless stood Ulric, watching the
lion, and between them now was but half the width of
the arena. Men breathed not, but leaned forward in their
places, and now the eyes of the great beast perceived the
jarl and he roared with the roar of hunger and wrath.</p>

<p>"Now for thy Saxon!" said Julius to Caius. "I think
his hour hath come."</p>

<p>"O jarl!" murmured Wulf. "Is it for this thou didst
sail to the Middle Sea? Where is now thy city of
Asgard!"</p>

<p>"Hark!" exclaimed Knud the Bear. "Another cometh!
Here is more treachery! A tiger!"</p>

<p>Not with a roar, but with a snarl that was dreadful
did the Hyrcanian monster rush from his den into the
arena. He was more terrible to look upon than was even
the lion, and he paused not in his going. He seemed to
rush along the ground, crouching stealthily, and he
looked longer and larger as he went.</p>

<p>"The jarl is lost!" said Tostig the Red. "O to be near
with my spear for one cast. This is twain upon one!"</p>

<p>"This was thy bargain," said Caius to the cunning
Julius. "Thy tiger was to contend with the swordsman
of my naming. I have appointed this chief."</p>

<p>"So be it!" said Julius calmly. "I accept!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" muttered Ben Ezra to the Saxons. "The
beasts have seen each other. Mark now the swift movement
of the jarl! The lion is about to spring! The
tiger! O God of Israel, aid thou, even though he be a
heathen!"</p>

<p>The tiger's rush was rapid and Ulric sprang forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
as if to meet him; but the lion was in the air with a vast
bound, his black mane streaming and his teeth showing
in the cavern of his jaws.</p>

<p>Not upon Ulric did he alight, however, for at his spring
and roar the tiger turned in his tracks as toward one who
would wrest from him his intended prey. Past both of
them darted the jarl as the Numidian fell heavily upon
the Hyrcanian; then his turning was as the light in its
quickness and he thrust with his might upon the beasts
as they grappled each other, rolling upon the ground and
tearing.</p>

<p>"He hath cut off one forepaw of the tiger," exclaimed
Knud. "That thrust was at the lion. Again! Again!
Such roaring was never heard."</p>

<p>The wild beasts tore as they roared and the multitude
uttered loud outcries, but all of the movements in the arena
were untellably rapid, nor might they who were watching
separate Ulric from his two enemies. He was with them
at every spring and turn and roll. The long, keen sword
dripped blood and the white skin of the son of Odin was
spattered redly, as if he were sorely wounded.</p>

<p>"If he be slain at all thou losest," said Julius.</p>

<p>"O friend," replied Caius, "be thou contented. Thou
must buy thee better beasts than these."</p>

<p>"Mark!" exclaimed Tostig the Red. "That was a
thrust behind the shoulder. The tiger falleth undermost.
O jarl! Beware now of thy lion!"</p>

<p>Over the dying tiger stood the huge Numidian, panting
and roaring, and before him stood the jarl, looking him in
the eyes.</p>

<p>"Splendid is he!" exclaimed Ben Ezra. "Jehovah of
Hosts, be with him now! It is the last."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Forward went the lion, but not with a bound, and he
swerved in his rush owing to his many wounds. High
in the air and over him, in a leap for life, went the son of
Odin, and as his feet touched the earth he turned, thrusting
swiftly, and he sprang again. Wild were the plaudits
of the multitude, but the lion was staggering and his
roar was muffled.</p>

<p>"One thrust more," muttered Ulric. "I am sorely
spent and I bleed. Hael, Odin! I have cloven his heart!
He dieth!"</p>

<p>Then turned he and walked steadily to the front of the
place of the great ones, while a vast clamor arose in all
the tiers of seats.</p>

<p>"O Saxon," said Caius, "art thou wounded?"</p>

<p>"A scratch or two," replied the jarl, cunningly. "Am
I to fight another lion this day, or wait I until the
morrow?"</p>

<p>"O Caius, the sesterces are thine," said Julius. "Thy
barbarian hath won for thee. Never saw I the like of
this."</p>

<p>"To thy place, O jarl," shouted Caius. "I come to thee
quickly. Be thou silent!"</p>

<p>Away strode Ulric, stepping proudly, but the door of
the room he sought opened as he came.</p>

<p>"Enter! Enter!" shouted Knud the Bear. "O our
beloved, art thou slain?"</p>

<p>"Water, quickly!" said Ulric. "I would drink. Wash
me also. Bind up my hurts and put on my mail. Let no
man see these tearings in my limbs. I shall not die!"</p>

<p>"Glory to the God of Israel!" exclaimed Ben Ezra. "I
am the physician for thy hurts. Bring bandages. These
are not to death. I feared for thee greatly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nevertheless," growled Wulf the Skater, "I will slay
that master of the games. O jarl, if we had lost thee!"</p>

<p>So said the other Saxons, crowding down to greet him,
but the bandages were made firm, the mail and the helmet
were put on, and then out across the arena marched they
all, the jarl leading them.</p>

<p>"Truly he is not slain," muttered Julius. "I have lost
my beasts and my sesterces!"</p>

<p>At the great portal, however, Caius waited with a
chariot.</p>

<p>"Not to thy quarters, O Saxon jarl," he said. "I take
thee to Capernaum for thy healing. All thy men will
follow now, and a ship waiteth at the seaside. Julius
must not see how thou art wounded. Wilt thou live?"</p>

<p>"He will live," said Ben Ezra. "Speak not now.
Harm was done by claws, but more by a paw stroke on
the head. But for that he had slain them sooner, and he
was torn only while he was fallen. A hard battle, O
Caius of Thessalonica."</p>

<p>"He and his have beaten Julius for me," said Caius.
"They shall fight no more save at Jerusalem and at
Rome."</p>

<p>"May we tarry long enough to offer sacrifices to the
gods of this place?" asked Knud. "I would leave them
in good humor. It is well to be on good terms with the
gods."</p>

<p>"What sayest he?" asked Caius of Ben Ezra, but Ulric
himself responded:</p>

<p>"Peace with thy gods, O Knud. Let alone. I saw
when I was under the tiger's paw. I thought at first of
the valkyrias, but they came not. The gods of this place
we will leave here. They are nothing to us. Come!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"So be it!" said Knud. "I meant only to deal prudently.
Thou art our jarl. We will come."</p>

<p>They lifted Ulric into the chariot, Ben Ezra and Knud
and Tostig entering with him, and the other Saxons followed,
led by Wulf the Skater. With them now was
Abbas, and he said to Ben Ezra:</p>

<p>"The keeper of the tiger's cage hath lost his head for
letting him out too soon, and the master of the games
lieth slain under the tiers, no man knoweth by whose
hand."</p>

<p>"They who butcher many," said Ben Ezra, "do well
to avoid knives. The man with all other men for enemies
dieth speedily."</p>

<p>But Wulf the Skater smiled joyously and he said to
Lars, the son of Beolf, at his side:</p>

<p>"The Jew is a wise one; but beware thou of Abbas,
lest he sell thee."</p>

<p>Lars looked at the spear in his hand and at Abbas, and
he answered not.</p>

<p>"We have our jarl!" laughed Wulf as they went forward,
and quickly they were at the shore of the Sea of
Galilee, and they saw a galley, like a pleasure boat, rowing
rapidly nearer to the place where the chariot halted.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Jarl and the Rabbi.</small></span></h2>


<p>Softly and easily may a wounded man be borne along
upon cushions over smooth water under a silken canopy.
There was no further fatigue for the jarl, the victor, that
day, and before its close he lay upon a couch in a room
of one of the seaside palaces. All men went out from him
save Caius.</p>

<p>"O jarl, my friend," he said, "I must leave thee. Gain
thou thy strength as rapidly as thou mayest. Thy Jew,
Ben Ezra, telleth me that he may not tarry here."</p>

<p>"He is not any more needed while I lie thus," said the
jarl. "I would see him. If thou art willing, he may go."</p>

<p>"I consent," said Caius. "Thou art interpreter enough
for thy men. I will send him to thee, but now I must
return to Tiberias, for I have much upon my hands. May
all the gods give thee a speedy recovery, and I promise
thee that thou shalt yet fight before Cæsar himself. Thou
art worthy!"</p>

<p>So saying, the centurion departed, and in a moment
more Ben Ezra came and sat down sadly by the side of
Ulric.</p>

<p>"Thou goest from me?" asked the jarl.</p>

<p>"Hardly of mine own will," replied Ben Ezra, "but I
must go to Jerusalem, and I will return to thee if thou
comest not soon to me. I commit thee to the keeping of
Jehovah, my god. Abbas goeth also, and there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
one double tongue the less in Galilee. Fare thee well. I
have done for thee what I could."</p>

<p>"O Jew, I thank thee," said the jarl. "Come thou
again to me and I will ever welcome thee as if thou wert
of my kindred."</p>

<p>Little more did they say, for the jarl was in fever and in
pain and the hour was late. Ben Ezra departed, but at
the door of the room stood Tostig, spear in hand,
although this palace was a place of peace.</p>

<p>"O Tostig," said Ben Ezra. "I go away for a season.
Guard thee well your jarl!"</p>

<p>"That will we, O Jew," said Tostig. "There will be
swords and spears around him by day and night.
Whither goest thou?"</p>

<p>"To Jerusalem," said Ben Ezra, "and I think I may
have somewhat to do there for thy jarl. I love him much.
I come again shortly."</p>

<p>"The gods go with thee," said Tostig. "I think thee
a brave warrior. Art thou sure that the jarl healeth of
these hurts?"</p>

<p>"No man knoweth surely," said Ben Ezra, "but see ye
to it that he hath quiet."</p>

<p>"We will care for that," said Tostig. "I have been
sore wounded myself, and while the cuts were knitting I
would fain have cleft the head of any who came near me."</p>

<p>So Ben Ezra departed from Tiberias, taking with him
Abbas, and the palace of the friend of Caius by the Sea
of Galilee contained now only the servants of its owner
and these who were called the gladiators of Caius of
Thessalonica. For these there was sufficient occupation
of mind at the first, for many came to gaze at them, and
men of rank, also, were interested, but none might ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
undue questions of men whose speech was unknown and
whose behavior was silent and haughty. To them, also,
not only were all buildings new to be examined, but there
were fruits and wines and strange ways of living to
become accustomed to. Boats were there, to be used at
any time, and the Saxons talked much of the fiords and
fishing of their own land while they were amusing themselves
upon the Sea of Galilee. Over it did they go from
end to end that they might look upon all things upon its
shores, and they wondered much that one small sea
should contain such abundance of fishes and have so many
towns and cities builded beside it, as if there were no
other place for the cities of this marvelous land. Few
days went by in this manner, but there were other affairs
than those of the Saxons.</p>

<p>Ever is it true that the cunning, who believe their ways
to be hidden, are sometimes read as are books in strange
tongues read by those who are learned in difficult runes.
Julius, the centurion, the chief commander of the Roman
forces in Galilee, had other hopes and ambitions than the
winning of sesterces in gambling, and he had other cunnings
besides his tricks of the circus. At this time Herod,
tetrarch of Galilee and loving to be called a king, was
plotting to gain for himself the entire realm which had
been ruled by his cruel father, Herod the Great. To this
end he might require the removal by Cæsar of Pontius
the Spearman from being procurator, and the destruction
of his own brother, Herod Antipas, tetrarch of the lands
northward of Galilee. If, therefore, Herod of Machærus
and Julius, the centurion, were working together against
the procurator, then the near friend of Pontius was as a
spy and an enemy in their camp. Nevertheless, Caius of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Thessalonica had been received in Tiberias with all the
welcoming due to an exceedingly distinguished visitor,
an honored friend. Not that Herod was here to meet
him at this time, for the tetrarch preferred the safekeeping
of his Black Castle, Machærus, on the easterly
side of the Sea of Death, which hath no waves and
whereon the seabirds die.</p>

<p>Caius, the centurion, walked one evening alone by the
shore of the Lake of Galilee, and he communed deeply
with himself.</p>

<p>"Thus far Jove hath been with me. I have escaped
the treachery of both the wolf Julius and the foxes, the
Herods. I do now know that Herod Antipas refuseth to
join them, to his ruin. Why linger I here, where I am not
safe for an hour but for the swords of my Saxon gladiators?
I trust their jarl, for they are his more than mine.
He mendeth but slowly from the tiger's clawing. I would
he were able to ride even in a chariot, for my errand here
is done. Unless he were with me I could do little with
his barbarians. Abbas is a traitor, ready for a buyer, and
I believe him already bought. Ben Ezra&mdash;he is a Jew,
and every Jew hateth every Roman, with good cause.
I am glad he hath departed. The barbarians are not so,
for they are but gladiators, and this Jarl Ulric is not as a
common man. I may trust him."</p>

<p>So spoke with himself the grim centurion, the near
friend of Pontius the Spearman, considering the affairs of
princes and of kingdoms. He walked on, thinking deeply,
and ere long he was at the palace by the seashore. A
legionary stood guard at the portal, but no Saxons were
to be seen.</p>

<p>If one had walked with these at this hour, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
have been at a place from which might be seen the walls
of Capernaum. Along the beach were boats and sailing
vessels, larger and smaller, and out upon the sea were
many fishermen. At the water side were some who
spread out a net to dry, but above them, on the high
ground, had gathered rapidly a mingled concourse of
people. Said one of the net dryers to another:</p>

<p>"The rabbi of Nazareth is there. He healeth the people.
Only John is with him. We ought not to be here.
Let us go to him."</p>

<p>"Did he not bid us go a-fishing?" replied another.
"We have caught many. It is enough. Let us go."</p>

<p>So left they their net and went up the bank, and as they
went they heard the voice of the rabbi preaching to the
multitude. They listened, hastening, and they spoke no
more to each other. All utterances were stilled save the
wonderful voice of the preacher, the music of the waves
upon the beach, and the low, painful mutterings of one
man who hobbled along upon crutches as if to join the
gathering.</p>

<p>"O that I am to be maimed!" he said. "I, Ulric, the
son of Brander! That I shall no more walk firmly! The
tendons and the muscles of my limbs refuse to heal, as if
the tiger's claws were poisonous. What thinkest thou,
Wulf the Skater? Shall we not go on and see this man?"</p>

<p>"Thou art faint, O jarl," said Wulf. "It is not well
that thou hast walked so far. I fear thou wilt but cure
the more slowly. One goeth by us! Look at him! Hear
him! He is a leper!"</p>

<p>"Unclean! Unclean! Unclean!" a hoarse and croaking
sound came to their ears from the ulcered, shriveled
lips of him at whom Wulf pointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind him were four who carried a sick one in a
litter, but they held back, not overtaking the leper.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ulric. "I would look into the face of
this god once more. We may hear another of the demons.
I have much curiosity concerning them. Put thy arm
around me and aid me on."</p>

<p>"Woe is me, son of Brander," moaned Wulf, but his
strong arm went around the waist of his jarl and they
walked along.</p>

<p>"Unclean! Unclean! Unclean!" the terrible voice
repeated, but on the brow of a little knoll the rabbi of
Nazareth stood and ceased not his preaching.</p>

<p>All around him were men and women, the old and the
young, but these stepped suddenly away, as if in fear,
while the leper came toward them.</p>

<p>"He hath no right!" exclaimed one.</p>

<p>"Touch him not! Breathe not his breath," said
another, "lest thou become leprous!"</p>

<p>Down knelt the leper, but the rabbi ceased speaking and
looked upon him kindly.</p>

<p>"What wilt thou?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That I might be clean," gasped the leper.</p>

<p>"Be thou clean!" said Jesus.</p>

<p>"O jarl!" exclaimed Wulf. "What is this? He
standeth erect! He is strengthening! Would almost
that thou wert a Jew, for their god is a strong healer."</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ulric. "He hath cured this leper. I
will have speech with him. Nearer! I walk more easily.
My hurts cease to pain as they did. O Wulf, aid me
strongly, that I may get to him. Pass me on! I breathe
more freely! I strengthen! I fail not! Fear thou not
for me that this shall do me harm!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>
<p>"O jarl!" said Wulf. "This is but a sudden strength
that cometh to thee. Afterward thou wilt fall!"</p>

<p>"On! On!" exclaimed the jarl. "I have somewhat to
say that I had forgotten. I must speak!"</p>

<p>Near were they now, and the rabbi of Nazareth again
ceased speaking as he looked upon the white face of the
jarl, but the crutches of Ulric had fallen from his hands
and the arm of Wulf seemed still to uphold him.</p>

<p>"O thou Jesus, of the sons of the gods," said the jarl.
"Sigurd, the son of Thorolf, hath fallen in battle with
robbers, many of whom he slew. He bade me that I
should see thee again and bring thee his greeting."</p>

<p>"O rabbi of the Jews!" exclaimed Wulf the Skater,
earnestly, "it is Ulric, the son of Brander the Brave, of
the Northland. His gods are not thy gods, for he is a
son of Odin, whom thou knowest not. But he is our jarl
and we love him. We pray thee that thou wilt ask of thy
god for him that his hurts may be healed and that he may
become strong to lead us, for we are but as lost children
without him."</p>

<p>As yet Jesus answered not, but the jarl stood firmly
upon his feet and stepped one step nearer, Wulf stepping
with him, but of the other Saxons was none with
them.</p>

<p>"O rabbi," said Ulric, "I was torn by wild beasts in the
arena of Tiberias. I slew both the lion and the tiger,
while they were tearing each other. And now I shall be
no more a warrior, for my sword falleth from my hand."
As he spoke he held out the hand which had been so
strong, and which was now so weak, and it was touched
by the outstretched hand of this rabbi of Nazareth.</p>

<p>"Go, thou," he said. "Be thou healed. And remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
thou that which thou hast this day seen and heard. Speak
not again now."</p>

<p>Wulf the Skater took up the crutches, but the jarl put
them away, saying:</p>

<p>"Hath he not bidden us to go our way? Shall we not
now do as he hath said? Come! I walk as if I had not
been torn. He is a god!"</p>

<p>"O jarl," whispered Wulf, trembling, "what meaneth
he? I understand him not. And what is this strange
thing which hath come upon thee, as if thou wert a Jew?
I think his god is a good god and very strong."</p>

<p>But both he and Ulric stepped backward and the rabbi
and the man who was leprous stood face to face.</p>

<p>"Silence, Wulf the Skater!" whispered Ulric. "The
god hath spoken to me as to this one. I have looked into
his face. What he hath said I know not, but I go to Caius
quickly. Where thou art commanded well do thou obey
lest evil befall thee."</p>

<p>"Clean! Clean!" sprang from the lips of the healed
leper. "Hallelujah! I glorify the god of Abraham.
This man is a great rabbi!"</p>

<p>"He is of the sons of the gods, thou stupid one!" said
Ulric. "I am healed. Who but a god can cure the
scratch of a lion or a tiger? He is as Odin, and I think
they are friends, and that Odin bade him heal me. I will
fight for him when he gathereth his army. O Wulf the
Skater, come! My arm telleth me that I could cast a
spear. O thou of Nazareth, thank thy father for me, for
thou wilt see him before I do. When I am slain I shall
go to Asgard and I will meet him there, and I hope to
meet thee. Also, in thine hour, thou shalt be my captain."</p>

<p>"Go now!" said Jesus, turning to a sick one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"He meaneth he will send for thee," said Wulf, walking
on at the side of Ulric. "But we need more Saxons
for his army if he is to overcome the Roman legionaries.
He would do well to gather the sea kings and all the men
of the fiords and of the forests. Even from Denmark and
the islands we might bring to him good fighters. How
well could a captain keep his army if he might heal all
who were but hurt, losing only the heroes for whom the
valkyrias had come."</p>

<p>"I walk more strongly!" said Ulric. "I would be
where I may look at myself, for the marks were deep and
they ran as sores. We will go with Caius to Jerusalem.
I think it well for us that we guard him."</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Wulf, "a friend is a friend, but a Roman
valueth a Saxon only for his sword and for his spear. I
have thought, indeed, that he might yet give one of us
a chance to kill this Julius. I shall not be fully contented
until I have seen his blood upon a blade of steel."</p>

<p>As a man in a dream walked Ulric, the son of Brander.
With him, looking at him as they went, walked Wulf the
Skater, and now other men drew near.</p>

<p>"How is it with the jarl?" asked Knud the Bear. "He
hath no crutches this day."</p>

<p>"He walketh strongly," said Tostig the Red. "His
face is ruddy and his eye is bright. Thou hast been with
him, O Wulf; what is this?"</p>

<p>"The son of Odin hath had speech with this god of the
Jews," slowly responded Wulf. "I myself asked for his
healing, but the sons of the gods are not like other men.
Hold ye your peace, for the jarl was bidden to tell no
man."</p>

<p>"Let him alone, then," said Tostig. "It is enough that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
he walketh so well. But yonder is the centurion, Julius,
talking with Caius."</p>

<p>"I am to slay him yet," said Wulf. "Watch ye, for we
belong to Caius."</p>

<p>Enough of Saxon knew their master to gather that
saying, and it pleased him well, for he turned and saw blue
eyes that flashed a little, and dark eyes that seemed to
ask his bidding.</p>

<p>"There is truth in these Saxons!" he said to himself.
"Were I to command the death of Julius, he were dead
this hour."</p>

<p>But at that moment the voice of Julius rose in a sound
of chiding.</p>

<p>"O Caius," he said, "I did indeed pay my wagers, as
became me, but thy Saxon died and the payment should
be restored to me. If the lion and the tiger slew him, the
wager is void."</p>

<p>"Justly spoken, O my friend," replied Caius; "but
knowest thou this man, or is he dead?"</p>

<p>Then turned Julius, wondering, for before him stood
the son of Brander smiling in a mockery, and saying:</p>

<p>"Hael to thee, O Julius, the captain! Hast thou
any wild beasts with thee this day? I am Ulric the
Jarl!"</p>

<p>Proud and strong he stood, with the sunlight upon his
golden curls and the strength of a hero showing in his
movements, but the centurions, both of them, stared at
him as if they were in amazement.</p>

<p>"Thou art not dead?" said Julius.</p>

<p>"O jarl, let him take thy hand," said Caius. "Let him
be sure of thee that thou art well."</p>

<p>"O Caius," said his enemy, "thy swordsman liveth. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
have been misinformed. But how were his wounds that
they have healed?"</p>

<p>"Scratches!" said Caius. "I have care for my gladiators
after a fight that they may be ready again. Hast
thou any to put against him for a thousand sesterces, man
for man?"</p>

<p>"That have not I!" exclaimed Julius, looking hard at
Ulric. "He hath cost me enough!"</p>

<p>Then, also, for he was cunning, he understood the looks
of the other Saxons, closing around the jarl lovingly, and
he ground his teeth, for the thought in his mind was:
"They would slay half a cohort of my dwarfs. They
would slay me, if Caius bade them. I would I had such
a bodyguard that knew nothing but mine own will."</p>

<p>So thought Caius in his mind, silently, but he said
aloud:</p>

<p>"O Julius, now the games are ended, and my mission to
thee from Pontius is fulfilled, I will set out on the morrow
for Jerusalem. The winter is here. What sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"The gods go with thee!" said Julius. "Also, if thou
art wise, take with thee thy swordsmen. Thou wilt be
safe by the way."</p>

<p>So he and Caius walked on by themselves toward the
palace and the Saxons gathered gladly around their jarl,
feeling of his wounds that were healed and wondering
greatly at his meeting with this son of the unseen god of
the Jews.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>Beautiful as Aphrodite.</small></span></h2>


<p>At the Damascus gate of the city of Jerusalem halted
a weary-seeming ass, upon whose back was a dusty and
travel-worn rider.</p>

<p>"Wonderful indeed is the grandeur of this city," he
had said, as his jaded beast toiled up the road from the
bridge over the Kidron. "I would willingly have paused
longer upon the Mount of Olives, but the lash of the
procurator is close behind all who ride upon his errands.
Somewhere in this city of the temple is my Sapphira even
now, but how shall she be made to know that I am here?
Not now, but I will climb over all barriers, even these
great walls and forts, until I find her."</p>

<p>At the gate was a Roman guard, and to the sentinel on
post rode Lysias, saying:</p>

<p>"O guard! From the procurator to the captain of the
gate! In haste! I am Lysias, a messenger, with a token
in writing. I may not dismount until he cometh."</p>

<p>The soldier saluted ceremoniously the name and authority
of the procurator, but he stirred not from his
place. He did but shout loudly, and an officer came forth,
to whom the Greek repeated his utterances.</p>

<p>"Sit thou in thy saddle," said the officer. "I may not
touch that which is in thy keeping. But the centurion
cometh shortly&mdash;the captain to whom thou art commanded
to make thy delivery."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>No word spoke Lysias to the important man when he
came, but the subofficer made the announcement and the
parcel from Pontius the Spearman was placed in the right
hands.</p>

<p>"O messenger," he said, "dismount. Thy beast is worn
out. So art thou. He will be kept for thee in the stables
of the procurator. Thou, too, wilt have refreshment.
Rest thee and be ready when thy return message shall be
prepared."</p>

<p>Here ended for the present the dangerous responsibilities
of Lysias, but in no manner had he yet escaped from
the grip which had been put upon him. The lodgings
to which he was speedily conducted were as a jail of
secure detention and from them he might not think of
going forth, lest evil should befall him. He might but
eat and sleep while his next duties were in course of
preparation. Nevertheless rest was sweet, and his dreams
were free to wander where they would, seeking a fair face
and welcoming eyes which might not now be far away.</p>

<p>Early upon the morrow he was summoned to come
forth, and he was led to the Damascus gate without having
had speech with any save with soldiers who were as
his jailers. Here a saddled horse of Arabia awaited him
and also a high official, whom he knew not, and the captain
of the gate, whom he had already seen.</p>

<p>"Hear thou with care, O messenger," said the latter,
sternly, handing to him sealed parchments. "This first
to the procurator, from me. These from the high priest
and from the captain of the temple. I give thee, also, a
spoken message, which may not be written, for thee to
deliver and then to forget; for thou art of the household
of the procurator, and he trusteth thee. Were another to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
hear these words, lost were his head and thine. Slain
is the secret messenger of Herod, and he went not to
Cæsar. Caius of Thessalonica is in Galilee watching
Julius, the subtle, who plotteth, also, with Herod and with
Herod Antipas. Caius may die there, or ere he returneth,
but he is trustworthy. Well were it that the procurator
should now leave his inspection of the garrisons and of
Samaria until a better day and that he should now return
to Jerusalem. Go!"</p>

<p>Words in reply or questioning might not be spoken.
Lysias sprang upon the Arabian horse, the letters being
hidden in his bosom. Away he rode down into the valley
of the Kidron, thinking within himself: "Great is the
peril to him who carrieth the secrets of rulers. Sure is
my death if I do not this errand well, and yet the very
doing of it may bring a sword upon me. And now I am
indeed of the household of Pontius, wherein is hidden
my Sapphira. Surely Venus and Juno are with me, and
Mercurius himself hath given me this fleet stallion to
ride. He goeth like the wind."</p>

<p>The remainder of that day went by, and the night also
came and went. Not any did the messenger have speech
with but seemed ready to speed him and glad to see him
go from them, as if in having met him might bide a future
peril. It was only in the forenoon of the next day, however,
that his Arabian steed was halted in the middle of
the northward highway, and before him in a gilded
chariot sat Pontius, the procurator, reading slowly
and thoughtfully the letters delivered to him by the
Greek.</p>

<p>"Thou hast done well," he said. "Thou art a speedy
messenger. Was there aught else?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here are ears near thee, most noble Pontius," replied
Lysias. "I pray thee bid me be prudent."</p>

<p>Down from the chariot sprang the procurator with a
fierce flush upon his face.</p>

<p>"Dismount thee! Come!" he said. "Back, all! I
would have speech with this man."</p>

<p>Not far behind the chariot, but not as if they belonged
to the same company, rode two men upon asses, of whom
one said to the other:</p>

<p>"A messenger, O Ben Ezra. There may be tidings of
importance. What sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"Silence! O Abbas," replied the other, "thus far our
god hath befriended us upon our way. Trifle not with
the business of the great lest the sword seek thee. Thou
art overcurious. Let it suffice that we are permitted to
travel under guard of the procurator's horsemen."</p>

<p>At the roadside now stood he and the Greek and none
dared approach them, for the spear of Pontius was in his
hand and his brow was dark. "Speak with care!" he said
to Lysias. "Forget not!"</p>

<p>"Thus said the captain of the gate," replied Lysias,
"and a centurion who stood by him and who gave me this
cornelian for a token, telling me not his name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cornelius of Cæsarea!" muttered Pontius, but the
Greek spoke on, uttering exactly the words which had
been given him.</p>

<p>"It is well," he said. "I have word of Caius that he is
wise and that his Saxon swordsmen are his bodyguard.
More than one secret messenger hath been slain, saith
Ben Ezra, the bringer of tidings from Galilee. Trust
him, but not the Jew Abbas who is with him, for he is of
Julius. I come to Jerusalem quickly. I will give thee a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
fresh horse in the morning and thou wilt again return,
but thou wilt wait for me in mine own house. Go, now,
and speak to these Jews, questioning them. What they
say thou wilt tell me. It is well that thou wilt be in the
school of Gamaliel and also in the service of the procurator,
but let no man know of more than of the school."</p>

<p>The strong man is often in desire of a willing servitor,
and it pleased Pontius that the eyes of the Greek brightened
with delight. His lips parted also, but the word
"Sapphira" that was upon them was not uttered aloud.</p>

<p>The ruler turned and walked away to his chariot and
Lysias remounted his weary horse.</p>

<p>"I must be cunning with these Jews," he thought;
"and in one of them is my deadly peril."</p>

<p>The train passed on and they were riding at his side.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" he asked of Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>There was no sign of recognition in the face of his
former comrade upon the good ship <i>The Sword</i>.</p>

<p>"I am a Jew of Spain," he responded, "and my name
is Ben Ezra. I go to fulfill a vow in the temple of
Jehovah at Jerusalem. Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"I am a Greek of Alexandria, named Lysias," was replied
as cunningly. "I am of the household of the procurator,
but I am also a student in the school of the great
Gamaliel. Thou doest well to perform thy vows. I am
now bidden to be with thee. And who is this man?"</p>

<p>"I am Abbas of Jerusalem," he said for himself, bowing
low to one who seemed to be trusted by Pontius the
Spearman. "I am a merchant and I have had dealings
with the procurator."</p>

<p>"O Abbas," said Lysias, "many have heard of thee.
Thou art a lender of money and thou art hard in thy deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>ings.
Why dost thou pretend that thou knowest me not?
Hast thou not seen me many times in the markets? I
think that thou art never seen in the schools. Tell me,
how was it with that trouble of thine that thou didst have
before the magistrate? Didst thou escape with no more
harm than a fine?"</p>

<p>"Nay! Nay!" exclaimed Abbas. "Speak not too much
of that matter. The judge compelled that unjust person
to pay me my dues and he was cast into prison. I exact
no more than my right."</p>

<p>"Thou art, then, a rare money-lender," said Lysias; but
the cunning of the Greek had succeeded and Abbas was
ready thenceforth to say to any inquirer that he knew this
man well.</p>

<p>"O youth," he said, "I will talk with thee further concerning
certain matters when we may have opportunity.
Be not thou too much influenced by what thou hearest.
Is there any news?"</p>

<p>"Tell us what things have occurred," added Ben Ezra,
"for we have been in Galilee. I journeyed thither as interpreter
for the Saxon gladiators of Caius, the centurion,
of Thessalonica. In his service am I to this day."</p>

<p>"A good man and highly honored," said Lysias. "He
is a friend of the procurator."</p>

<p>So they rode on conversing, but in Greek. Nor was it
difficult as they went for Ben Ezra, even aided by Abbas
unwittingly, to inform Lysias completely concerning the
doings of the Saxons.</p>

<p>"The procurator," he said, "calleth the gladiators of
Caius his own. Thou wilt soon meet them and I will
make thee acquainted with them."</p>

<p>"I will gladly have speech with such strange ones,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
said Lysias, "but the scholars of Gamaliel may not meddle
much with the circus."</p>

<p>Ere long as they rode he and Ben Ezra were able to be
out of hearing of Abbas and the others, but the speech of
the Jew was brief.</p>

<p>"O Greek," he said, "if thou art imprudent in this
matter, for thee is not the scourge, but the sword."</p>

<p>"And for thee crucifixion," said Lysias. "Fear not for
me. Thou art as I am, and we are one with the jarl and
his company."</p>

<p>The place of the procurator's abiding was at hand. It
was an ancient palace, which was also a fort, and they
who occupied it were of high degree. Of them the two
Jews and Lysias might see or know but little, but they
had quarters assigned them. In the morning orders came
to Lysias only, and he was quickly in the saddle with a
message for Cornelius, the centurion. If he found him
not at Jerusalem, he was to ride on after him, even to
Cæsarea.</p>

<p>"O to be in the procurator's house!" thought Lysias,
"for she will be there and I shall see her."</p>

<p>Even as he rode away from the palace gate, however,
bright eyes were upon him from a window above and a
young girl said in a low, musical voice:</p>

<p>"O Lysias! Lysias! Do I not know that he is in
search of me? Woe to him and woe to me if he should
find me! What is this which is come? Am I not happy
as I am? Surely I do love him. He is very beautiful.
He loveth me. But what have I, the favorite of the wife
of Pontius, to do with him? What have I to do with a
love that I lost so long ago and that is gone? It were but
a sharp peril now. If I meet him, I can but tell him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
I am no longer his. He is but a swift messenger of the
procurator; a fellow to ride horses and to be scourged if
he rideth not speedily. I am one to dwell in palaces,
wearing gay apparel and jewels and having the favors
of the great."</p>

<p>Full of pride was her fair face as she spoke, and in it
was a scorn for any who were lowly. To her the apparel
of her servitude was more worth than was the love of a
youth who had been robbed of his patrimony and whose
rank was lost. She sat at the window watching him as he
rode away, and she sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I love him, and it is pleasant to love.
He is a good horseman. So are all my Roman lovers.
What is he compared with a Roman? Even the Jews, if
they are rich and of power, are better than a poor Greek
boy, fit only for errands."</p>

<p>She arose and walked away, but a mirror was near and
she gazed long at her reflection, admiring it greatly.</p>

<p>"I am as beautiful as Aphrodite, they tell me," she said.
"I will sacrifice to her this day, and to Juno. There are
no gods upon whom Lysias may call for great gifts. He
can bring them no rich offerings, while I can have oxen
slain before the altar. Aye, and I have had men sent to
prison and to the arena if they offended me. I sent that
foolish Jew girl to the lions at Jerusalem. I taught her
better than to interfere with me."</p>

<p>Her red lips tightened cruelly, and her eyes were terrible
and her movements were lithe as those of a young
panther as she walked on along a corridor. But Lysias
galloping northward was alone upon the highway, and he
shouted aloud:</p>

<p>"Sapphira! Sapphira! My beautiful one! My be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>loved!
I am drawing nearer to thee! Thou art dearer
than life and I believe thou art true to thy lover. I will
find thee yet, and I will look into thine eyes and I will
touch thy hand and I will tell thee all that is in my heart."</p>

<p>Strong is love and wonderful are its follies and its
treacheries, for even then his Sapphira sank upon a couch
in her own room sighing and murmuring in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Lysias! Lysias! My beloved! If I have any other
lovers I will name them Lysias in my mind, for I do love
thee, and love is pleasant."</p>

<p>The procurator made no great haste that morning,
although he prepared for journeying. He had many
affairs and his messengers came and went, and it might
be seen that he was a thoughtful governor, attending to
all who came, only that he sent out some edicts which
were full of blood and vengeance.</p>

<p>Not long was it before he stood in a private place with
Ben Ezra questioning.</p>

<p>"O Jew," he said, "now thou hast told me how Julius
plotted to destroy the Saxon guards of Caius, thou hast
told me enough. But for this tall jarl of thine and his
pirates I should never again meet my friend. He may
give them to me and I will not waste them in the arena.
I know of a place to which I may send a good sword and
where I may not send a legionary."</p>

<p>Low bowed the Jew and the unspoken word in his heart
was bitter.</p>

<p>"Do I not know thee?" he thought. "Thou treacherous
one! Thou wilt send a Saxon to do a deed, and when
it is done for thee thou wilt slay him and clear thyself.
This is the cunning of the Romans. I will beware of thee
and thy errands, but I care little for my own neck. O that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the Messiah, the Prince of Judah, were even now smiting
thee and thine from the earth! He cometh soon, I think."</p>

<p>So, bowing as became his station, but guarding well
his face and letting his eyelids fall over any glitter that
might betray him, Ben Ezra went out of the palace and
was joined by Abbas.</p>

<p>"O my friend," said Abbas, "why linger we?"</p>

<p>"We may not linger," said Ben Ezra. "We depart, but
thou wilt travel alone. I have commands from the procurator.
See to it that thou art quickly in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Whither goest thou?" asked Abbas.</p>

<p>"Art thou mad?" said Ben Ezra. "Or dost thou know
but little of Pontius? Keep thy questions to thyself and
tarry thou not, for I think thou hast a spot on thy name.
Beware lest it turn into red on thy garments."</p>

<p>Very pale was Abbas, but his face was that of a fox
with a wolf for his father.</p>

<p>"O Ben Ezra," he said, "thy counsel is good. But be
thou careful of thine own head. I can tell much concerning
thee."</p>

<p>"In the day that thou chatterest unwisely," said Ben
Ezra, "thou wilt spread thy arms upon a piece of wood
and thou wilt hear the sound of hammers. Then thou
wilt be set up at a wayside for men to mock thee. The
Romans hesitate but little concerning such as thou art."</p>

<p>Ghastly was now the face of Abbas.</p>

<p>"O my friend!" he exclaimed, "I meant no evil! I will
be true to thee!"</p>

<p>"Thou wilt remember this thy warning!" said Ben
Ezra, sternly. "Thou wilt not sin against thine own life.
If thou shalt at any time err, it is no fault of mine. Thy
blood is upon thine own head."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>They parted one from another, and then came to pass
a strange thing, for a servitor led Ben Ezra to the armory
of the palace. Here he remained but briefly, and when he
came out he was armed from head to foot in the panoply
allotted to the Jewish servants of the temple under its
Roman captain. So arrayed he might ride as if he were
a Roman under the sure protection of the procurator. A
horse was ready for him and he mounted, riding to the
palace gate. At this place was now the procurator in his
chariot.</p>

<p>"Go thou speedily as thou hast said," commanded the
procurator. "Be not overhasty, but prudent. If it prove
as thou tellest me, well with thee."</p>

<p>"On my head be it," said Ben Ezra, and he rode away
northward.</p>

<p>"I have purchased him with a price," he said to himself,
"but I will deal truly with the jarl. If some of his
treasure and some of mine must be paid as tribute to this
Roman governor, all that remaineth&mdash;and it will be
enough for us&mdash;will be kept for our own uses. Now for
the cavern in Carmel, and the journey will be neither long
nor unsafe for a man traveling with the seal of Pontius."</p>

<p>As for the procurator in his chariot, he, too, had a
thought upon his mind, and it made his face brighten.</p>

<p>"The gold is well," he thought, "but the jewels! There
is naught else for which Cæsar hath so great a lust. I
care little for such things. Of what value are bright
stones except that they will sometimes buy more than will
gold or silver? Let the Jew bring his gems and with
them I will defeat Herod and Julius."</p>

<p>Far on along the southward highway rode Abbas, having
a pack beast with him and two fellow-travelers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Jerusalem road through Judea was accounted safe unless
one rode alone or unarmed. Still was his face turned
backward now and then as that of one who feareth lest
he may be followed, for the words of Ben Ezra had been
severe, and Abbas knew that he who uttered them had
been much in conversation with the procurator.</p>

<p>"He is deep as a well!" he thought. "Can he know anything
of my dealings with Herod? Even now I must
go to the ford of the Jordan and to Machærus before I
go to Jerusalem. Alas! The Black Castle! How many
have entered it who never were seen again! Well is it set
so near to the Sea of Death! I am a Jew! I hurt not my
own people! But it is righteous to profit by the dissensions
of the heathen. If Herod and his brother Antipas
and this Pontius the Spearman were to slay one another,
what harm to the children of Abraham? Ben Ezra doeth
not well to keep faith with a Roman or an Edomite. They
have defiled even the temple of the Most High."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Javelin of Herod.</small></span></h2>


<p>The Saxons and their jarl in the palace by the Sea of
Galilee were now more impatiently awaiting the orders
of Caius of Thessalonica. It was at the close of a day
that he came to have speech with Ulric, the son of
Brander, and to wonder again at his swift healing. He
examined the scars, touching them, and asking many
things concerning this learned rabbi of Nazareth and of
his marvelous cures, for these were things which no
reasonable man might easily believe.</p>

<p>"Thou hast thy strength again," he said at last.
"Never have I thought much concerning the gods, but I
shall deem it prudent to make sacrifices to such as I think
may aid me. I have never found them profitable. Take
now thy weapons and walk out along the shore with me,
for I am restless. I linger here too long on thy account.
Come!"</p>

<p>"I shall delay thee no longer, O noble Caius," said the
jarl, "but well am I assured that thou doest well to wear
mail and to have thy good sword at thy side. Put on thy
helmet."</p>

<p>"So do thou," said Caius. "But what said to thee the
Jew, thy interpreter? Was it aught more important than
thou hast told me?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Ulric, "but the keeper of the tiger's den
told much unwittingly. The beasts were prepared to win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
more than sesterces. Had I been slain, and Tostig, thou
wouldst now have less perfect guarding. I will tell thee,
O Caius: I like thee well and I am jarl; not another will
my men obey. I think thee a good fighter, and such as I
am agree not well with cowards or with those who deal in
subtleties."</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Caius, "speak not of Julius, the centurion,
as if he were a coward, but he is exceedingly deep
in his counsels. There is more than thou knowest in this
matter. Thou mayest yet have a chance to use thy long,
sharp sword again."</p>

<p>"That might please me well," said the jarl. "I like not
to leave a blade too long in the sheath lest it might rust.
But glad am I as we walk to feel no more any hindrance
from the work of the tearing claws."</p>

<p>"Well with thee, O jarl!" exclaimed Caius. "And now
look without looking and mark well without seeming to
mark. Seest thou the men in armor who have landed
from yonder boat at the shore? They walk not overrapidly,
but they aim to come between us and the palace.
Canst thou read a riddle?"</p>

<p>"I had noted them already," said the jarl. "Men have
told me that the other shore of this Sea of Galilee belongeth
to Herod Antipas, the brother of the Herod who
ruleth here under Cæsar. I have heard that men who are
hated by the Herods die at distances. But thinkest thou
that either of them would dare to send a sword against a
Roman, and such as thou art?"</p>

<p>"Consider, O jarl," said Caius, calmly. "Who then
would know concerning the sword or him who sent it if
thou and I were slain upon this beach and our bodies
conveyed in yonder boat to be sunken in the sea? Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
not the thing be well hidden if the doers of it were shortly
also slain by Herod Antipas or by his brother, whichever
sent them?"</p>

<p>"Great would be the inquiry," said Ulric.</p>

<p>"Thou art young!" said Caius. "Cæsar might demand
my blood of him of Machærus, in whose land we are, or
even of this Julius. What if Antipas thus plotted harm to
both of them? He could strike them no deeper stab than
this! Thy spear, Saxon! O for my shield! I was imprudent!"</p>

<p>"Take mine!" said Ulric, casting his spear. "I need
it not. There are now but four. Ha! A javelin! I
caught it! Out with thy sword!"</p>

<p>Even while talking had they permitted the five men
from the boat to draw much nearer and as if unobserved.
Sudden and fierce had then begun this assailing. The
javelin had been well aimed, but the quick sword of the
jarl had parried it. These were men of war who were
coming and they had deemed themselves sure of victory,
for one had said:</p>

<p>"On! With him is no one but his tiger-torn gladiator.
He hardly may stand erect. The centurion is at our
mercy. End him!"</p>

<p>"Use well the shield," said Ulric. "Thou art thyself
a good swordsman."</p>

<p>Now he who seemed the leader of these murderers
drew back astonished to see how this Saxon, whom he
deemed crippled, sprang toward him with a war cry. He
was no match for such a one, and his next comrade, turning
affrighted to see him fall, left his own neck unguarded
against the sword of Caius. What then were the two
who remained against two mighty men of valor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Ill advised had been he who had sent them upon this
errand, for the jarl laughed exultingly to find how well
his strength had come back to him.</p>

<p>"O noble Caius!" he shouted. "Thou art a good
swordsman. They are all down. But these fellows are
Jews. How is this?"</p>

<p>"None the less are they from Antipas," said Caius.
"I can read his cunning. He will say they are but robbers
from the rebel bands beyond the Jordan. Therefore I
may bring no accusation against him. But I think thou
art enough for five such as these. Well is it for me
that thou art healed. Now will I send word to Julius, and
his servants may have the care of this carrion."</p>

<p>Ulric was silent, looking down upon the slain.
"Jews?" he said. "I think now that they are not so, but
they are like them. What is thy thought, O Caius?"</p>

<p>"Samaritans!" suddenly exclaimed the centurion after
a closer examination. "Not from Antipas. Here is a
deeper treachery. These are from the elder Herod, the
fox of Galilee. O jarl, haste! To the palace! We will
make ready for our journey. But know thou that our
road to Jerusalem passeth through Samaria, whence these
came. Verily I have a new tale to tell the procurator."</p>

<p>"And I have a new thought concerning the keeping of
thy life," said Ulric. "But there will be more than one
round shield with thee in Samaria. A man needeth to
have many eyes in this land."</p>

<p>At that moment, while they still gazed down at the
dark yet pallid faces of the dead, they heard near them
shouts of angry chiding, but the tongue was not the
tongue of that country.</p>

<p>"O jarl!" shouted Lars, the son of Beolf, "we saw thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
afar! We came in haste! What doest thou here with
thy sword in thy hand&mdash;thou that wert torn by the
Roman tiger?"</p>

<p>"Woe to thee, O jarl!" shouted another. "Thy men
should have been with thee!"</p>

<p>"O Caius," exclaimed Tostig the Red, "thou didst fight
for our jarl? Then will we fight for thee. Thou hast
made good friends this day."</p>

<p>Sufficiently well did Caius understand Tostig and the
others who now came running to see how it might be
with the son of Brander, and it pleased him greatly.</p>

<p>"I may now depend upon these wolves of the North,"
he thought, "and sore may be my need of such as they
who think not but strike, knowing only a friend and a
foe and taking no account of numbers against them."</p>

<p>The jarl explained the matter and he seemed to be forgiven,
but he and the centurion returned to the palace
surrounded by spears ready for the casting.</p>

<p>"It is well, O jarl," said Caius. "Let all be ready to
depart upon the morrow; but I may not go in unseemly
haste as in fear."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt go as becometh thee," said Ulric. "He who
fleeth unduly from a sword loseth the regard of brave
men. We will be ready."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Caius of Thessalonica rode swiftly to
the house of Julius at Tiberias and was himself the
bringer of this tidings.</p>

<p>Julius listened to him in a white wrath. "O thou, my
friend!" he shouted. "Seest thou not that this thing is
aimed at me as much as at thee? If thou hadst thus been
slain, it had been my utter ruin. Woe to these Herods!
They shall both fall by the sword of Cæsar. The gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
be with thy Saxons. Thou needest them. Commend me
unto Pontius and say to him that thou and I are henceforth
one in all these matters. The Herods now seek to
stab him also. Let him guard well his head."</p>

<p>So talked they long together in a nearness which they
had not known before, finding themselves in the same
peril from the serpents which bite in the dark.</p>

<p>From the gate of Tiberias on the morrow went out a
company worth the seeing. Not without armed Roman
escort and many bondservants might the chariots of so
important a man as Caius of Thessalonica set forth.
When to all these were added the vikings, in their best
armor and well mounted, it was as if a small army had
been ordered southward. To the place of parting and of
farewell came, also, Julius and many men of note to do
all honor to the friend of the procurator.</p>

<p>"O Caius," said Julius, "I already have a swift messenger
from Antipas. He hath sent his horsemen to search
the hills beyond the sea and Tarichæa. They will ride
with all diligence, and beyond doubt they will find some
to slay, but thy shield must be nearer to thee than is the
Jordan."</p>

<p>"It will be very near," said Caius, smiling, for near
him rode Tostig the Red watching all keenly, and his
spear was in his hand.</p>

<p>This, too, saw Julius, and he laughed.</p>

<p>"O my friend," he said, "it is even so. Fare thee well;
but they who come to meet thee should have due warning,
for thy protectors are no respecters of persons."</p>

<p>All then rode on, and the Saxons talked much among
themselves concerning the things which they had already
seen in this land. They had visited all towns and villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
around the sea, but none of them were more splendid
than Tiberias.</p>

<p>"I would have visited Capernaum," said Ulric.</p>

<p>"There is no great thing there," said Tostig the Red.
"What hadst thou in thy mind?"</p>

<p>"Only this," said the jarl: "that this son of the old god
of the Jews, this rabbi of Nazareth, dwelleth there at
times. I owe him thanks and gifts for my healing. Also
I have it in mind to ask him questions concerning my
father, and Hilda, and Valhalla, and Asgard. Hilda I
have not seen but in my dream on <i>The Sword</i>."</p>

<p>"One was with her, I heard thee say when thou didst
meet her. It was well to give her thy ring. I would have
done so. But what would this god of the Jews know
concerning thy maiden? The gods care not for such
things. She was fair to look upon. But, O Ulric the
Jarl, I would I were on the sea again!"</p>

<p>So said all the vikings many times, but they told the
jarl that not in any of their goings to Capernaum had
they seen Jesus, the rabbi. They had heard of him, that
he was away in other places, here and there, teaching and
preaching and healing many and casting out evil spirits.</p>

<p>"It is good that he so doeth," said Lars, the son of
Beolf, "and that he healed the tiger scratches upon the
jarl, but what good is it for him to sing sagas to these
people of no account?"</p>

<p>There was none to answer him, for even Ulric himself
was silent. Nevertheless, the son of Brander had many
thoughts which he did not utter and he forgot not any
of the words which he had heard spoken by this one who
had healed his hurts.</p>

<p>"I understand them not," he said to himself. "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
bade us think of the gods, and that I do. Even now I am
seeking their city and that I may get acquainted with my
kindred. How shall I do so completely before I am slain?
And he who dieth a cow's death, so say the sagas, shall
not enter Valhalla, but shall find his place in Hel. I
would join the heroes of the old time and dwell with
Thor and Odin. I think I shall know more after I have
seen the city Jerusalem, which Ben Ezra saith is like
Asgard. At all events I will sacrifice horses and oxen
and sheep in the temple of Jehovah as if he were Odin
himself, for he is the chief god of this wonderful land."</p>

<p>More and more wonderful indeed did it seem to the
Saxons as they rode onward all that day, for it swarmed
with inhabitants and the villages and towns were many
in number.</p>

<p>It was at the gate of Jezreel that their company halted,
at the setting of the sun, and Ulric sat upon his horse
looking toward Carmel. Behind the city arose Gilboa,
wooded and craggy. Before it stretched Esdraelon.</p>

<p>"O Wulf the Skater," said the jarl, "do you bear in
mind the things which were said of this city and plain
by Ben Ezra and Abbas?"</p>

<p>"More was said to thee than to others," replied Wulf.
"It is a city of sieges and a plain of many battles. I can
see the blue ridge of Carmel and beyond is the Middle
Sea. I would I might see waves this hour and smell the
salt air. This is a woeful land, where never is good ice
or deep snow. We go on into the winter and we may yet
see a snow squall if we are fortunate. But Knud will
need no bearskins and Wulf will need no skates&mdash;and I
sicken when I think of such a winter."</p>

<p>"The great battle of the end of the world and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
twilight of the gods!" exclaimed Ulric. "O ye! If Ben
Ezra's Jewish sagas lie not, here shall we witness the
greatest of all the feasts of swords. Here shall we have
for our jarl a god, the son of a god, and there will be gods
and heroes to fight with. I, the son of Odin, will be here!
Hael, Odin!"</p>

<p>"I will be with thee, then," said Knud, "but if it is soon
to come, it were better for some of us to go back to the
Northland and return with many keels full of men like
ourselves. This god will need Saxons if he is to fight
Romans. These Jews will go down like wheat before
the sickle, for I have been looking at them and at the
legionaries."</p>

<p>"Thou art right!" exclaimed Tostig the Red. "But
there is room on this plain for great armies to meet.
They will come from many places, Abbas told me, and
among them will also be black and yellow men, and there
will be great beasts, and the eagles that are wide-winged,
and creatures whereof he could not tell me the shape.
They may be like the one we saw come up from under
the ice to tear the whales, only that such as he do not
come out upon the land."</p>

<p>"No man knoweth from whence these will come," said
Knud, "but some of them are as great serpents with
wings. I like not to think of them, for they are full of
fire and sulphur, and who can fight well in a smoke that
choketh him?"</p>

<p>After this they entered the city of Jezreel, and they
wondered greatly at the strength of its walls and towers,
but they saw not many soldiers.</p>

<p>"The land is at peace," thought Ulric, "and garrisons
may be small. I am learning something of war cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
from these Romans. What they take they will hold until
a stronger people shall come against them. I know of no
such people except in the Northlands."</p>

<p>Yet another thought was in the mind of the jarl, and
his eyes wandered anxiously wherever he went. In all
towns and villages and whenever companies had been
met by the way he had seemed to be searching, and a
sadness of disappointment was growing upon his face.</p>

<p>"I heard her say she would see me at Jerusalem," he
told himself, "but now the time is long. She may have
come hitherward. Of these damsels whom I have seen
as I came many are fair to look upon, but none are as
beautiful as Miriam. Cannot Hilda lead me to her?
Shall I indeed not see Miriam until I meet her in Asgard?
I would that Caius were in greater haste. We travel
slowly."</p>

<p>If he had looked upon fair faces inquiringly with his
sad blue eyes, also had all the Saxons laughed to one
another quietly to note how many women put aside their
veils a little to turn for another look at the face of the jarl.</p>

<p>"Never before have these seen any like him," they said.
"They will not see him again, and he careth not for
women save for the one to whom he gave a token. He
will forever keep his troth with the dark one, the beautiful
one, in whose hand he put the ring of the bright red stone
as we came through Esdraelon."</p>

<p>Good welcome was given to Caius of Thessalonica and
his company by the governor of Jezreel, but the vikings
went to their quarters listlessly, for they had all looked
across the plain toward Carmel, and the thought within
them was that beyond Carmel was the sea and that upon
the sea were ships.</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Places of Sacrifice.</small></span></h2>


<p>Questions which are asked by the heart of a man
may go far. It is as if they were winged and flew on to
a chosen place of alighting, as do the messenger doves
carrying letters homeward. One of the birds set free by
the ever-beating heart of Ulric the Jarl found a wonderful
resting place.</p>

<p>It was in a house in a great city, and upon all the earth
was nothing more magnificent than this house of houses.
Upon the top of a high mount in the city was a vast space
girded with white walls and towers, so that of this whole
area was made a fortress of surpassing strength. Within
these walls were great buildings not a few and porticos
and separated courts for varied uses.</p>

<p>There was one building which was greater than any
of the others, and to this as to a center all the many
structures related; for the arrangement and the architecture
were everywhere exceedingly harmonious and
convenient. To this greatest building there were several
approaches, but the main entrance was by an ample ascent
of broad stone steps. Beyond the level at the head of this
stairway were mighty doors whose surfaces were covered
with beaten gold and many designs of golden ornamentation.</p>

<p>Within the doors, if one might enter&mdash;for here stood
ever armed guards&mdash;they who went on might see yet more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
splendors of carven stonework, whereof some of the
stones were rare and precious, and of golden and brazen
ornament. Here in high places were altars which smoked
with almost unceasing sacrifices. Serving at and about
the altars were numbers of robed priests with their assistants,
and often these were chanting the sagas of their
worship, but not in all this place was there any image
whereby a stranger might obtain information concerning
the shape or person of a god. It was as if he were worshiped
in ignorance, none having at any time seen him to
make a sculpture or a painting of his likeness.</p>

<p>In this inner space or court where were the altars there
stood this day a multitude of men with covered heads, and
they now and then uttered loud voices in unison, which
were responses answering the sagas of the priests.</p>

<p>Here were no women, but at the right was a portal
and a passage leading into another court, which was also
large and splendid. This was the court of the women,
of whom a large number were present, both of the young
and of the old.</p>

<p>This was the temple of Jehovah, the God of the Jews,
in the city of Jerusalem. To him only were any sacrifices
offered upon the altars, and the sagas were chanted that
he might hear them if he would, but none could tell
whether or not at any time he might be listening. So
many of the sagas formally besought him not to remain
at a distance, but to come to this place and listen and do
the things asked for by those who brought to his altars
these sacrifices.</p>

<p>Sad and sorrowful, yet full of strange music, was the
sound of this singing, while the smoke went up from the
burnings and while the censers were swung to and fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
by the priests to send out upon the air their clouds of
sweet odors. Sad and sorrowful was the pleading, for
there cometh a heaviness of soul to him who calleth in
vain upon a god who is far away, who is unseen, and who
answereth not by voice or sign.</p>

<p>On the stone pavement, near to a pillar of bright bronze-work
and somewhat apart from any of the groups of the
other women, knelt one who was veiled and whose voice
arose in low murmurings as of a recitation and a prayer.
The hand which drew her veil more closely was well
shaped and white and upon one of its fingers was a golden
ring among other rings less beautiful. So deep was the
red light of the ruby in this ring that its glow seemed
hot like fire, and it throbbed as if it had pulses at the
movement of her hand changing the light upon it. Also
her bosom arose and fell and there were tremors in her
voice, and she said, whispering softly in the old Hebrew
tongue:</p>

<p>"O thou who art God over all gods, I have sinned to
look upon him, for I am a daughter of Abraham and he
is one of the heathen. O that he might also be one of
Abraham's children and serve the living God, even our
God. I have sinned, O Jehovah of Hosts, but I have made
my sin offering and I have made an offering of atonement
also for him."</p>

<p>Then the gem flashed a great light, but her hand fell
and her veil slipped away and the marvel of her face was
seen for a moment. Upon it was a smile and a light, and
her eyes were closed, but her lips were parted.</p>

<p>"Have I indeed been spoken to?" she whispered. "I
have been told that an angel cometh oft into the court of
the women. Never have I seen an angel. Who knoweth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
that one might not come to me? Would he be fairer to
look upon than was he whom I saw at the wayside? If
this be truth, then do I know that my offering hath been
accepted and that it is no longer a sin for me to remember
him. Woe is me, then, if I am to never see him more!
O he was beautiful! Exceedingly! And I have brought
into the house of Jehovah this token which he gave me.
But what is this which hath come to me?"</p>

<p>Her eyes were opened, looking downward, and the red
glow of the ruby answered them as if it were speaking
to her of love. Then she arose, covering with her long
silken veil, and she walked out of the court of the women;
but a dove, escaped from the cages of the offerings, flew
over her head and went out above the great gate and the
wall, flying swiftly until he disappeared over the Mount
of Olives.</p>

<p>On walked the young woman beyond the temple walls
and the sacred mount, going until she came to a street of
palaces, ascending another mount. Here shortly she disappeared,
but she was more beautiful than any palace and
in her light stepping there were both gracefulness
and a great pride of manner, as if she were of high
degree.</p>

<p>Now at that hour of the evening sacrifice the city was
exceedingly still, for men and women everywhere paused
in whatever they were doing and turned their faces
toward the temple. Horsemen drew rein and chariots
halted, and there were many who knelt even in the open
streets. But of these were none but Jews and Jewish
proselytes from other nations, and there were those who
were worshipers of other gods that were sufficient for
them. Roman soldiers who were marching halted not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and of these a body of a hundred spearmen passed out at
the Damascus gate with an officer at their head.</p>

<p>"O captain of the gate," he shouted, "yonder cometh
a messenger. I will await him."</p>

<p>"Hinder him not!" replied the keeper of the gate.
"He is known to me. It is the swift messenger of the
procurator."</p>

<p>"Am I not captain of the temple?" shouted the officer
so loudly that he who came heard him.</p>

<p>"If thou art he," was uttered, hastily, "I pray thee
come to me!"</p>

<p>For the messenger halted, not dismounting.</p>

<p>"Dog of a Greek!" exclaimed the captain of the temple,
haughtily, "shall I come to thee?"</p>

<p>"There are men with thee and in the gate, O captain,"
said Lysias, reverently. "I pray thee permit me to obey
the procurator and speak to thee only."</p>

<p>"Ho! Thou art right. I come! Hast thou a letter
from Pontius?"</p>

<p>"This little script only," said Lysias, handing him a
parchment, "and these words&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Utter them quickly!" said the officer.</p>

<p>"'Pontius to the captain of the temple: slay the messenger
of Herod Antipas and let the spy from Machærus
not live to sail for Rome. Speed this Lysias to Cornelius,
the centurion, and keep him afterward in my house safely
until I come. Let him have speech with no man and let
no harm come to him.'"</p>

<p>"Even so!" said the captain of the temple. "Yonder
road along the valley of the Kidron bringeth thee to the
Joppa gate. From thence is the Joppa highway, and
thou wilt find Cornelius at the harbor fort if he hath not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
departed for Cæsarea. I will give thee a fresh horse.
Tarry not in Joppa or in Cæsarea, but return quickly to
me."</p>

<p>"But not to speech with the high priest," said Lysias,
"nor to any from Herod."</p>

<p>"I will see to that," laughed the captain. "Thou art
careful of thy head. Wert thou unmindful of the commands
of Pontius, thy shoulders were bare quickly. Thy
fresh horse cometh. Mount and ride on."</p>

<p>Without more words Lysias obeyed, but as he rode on
along the brook Kidron he said aloud: "Well for me that
I took rest and food while I could, that I fall not from
my horse. I can reach Joppa in due season, but what will
yonder captain of the temple do with me when I return?
I have heard that the messengers of Roman governors
are changed like the changing of guards, and that they
who are released go sometimes upon errands from which
they do not return. I will sacrifice to Mercury!"</p>

<p>Whether or not he were weary, Lysias rode well and
his fresh horse was swift. It was but little to reach the
Joppa gate, and the sun was but setting when he turned
into the highway leading toward the sea. It was broad
and well kept, for chariots and for marching cohorts.
Looking back, Lysias saw that the gate was closed and
none was in the road behind him. Looking forward, he
saw no man, but there were houses on either side of the
way except at one wide, open space which arose at the
left in a small hill. Bare was this ascent and he wondered
at it, saying to himself:</p>

<p>"So near the gate and no building thereon? It were
a place for one of these outer palaces."</p>

<p>He had paused to fasten the buckle of his bridle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
he looked again upon the hill, and now shriek after shriek
of utter agony came to his ears from beyond the crest of
the ascent. Voice answered unto voice, and he shuddered
as he heard, but a man in armor came slowly down the
slope.</p>

<p>"In the name of the procurator!" shouted Lysias. "Is
this the Joppa road?"</p>

<p>"Art thou of his messengers?" said the soldier. "If
thou art, thine ears will tell thee that a score of his
enemies are on the wood. This place of skulls will soon
smell but badly under this hot sun. Ride on, for this is
thy right road."</p>

<p>"This, then, is the hill of crucifixion?" asked Lysias.</p>

<p>"Any place will do," said the soldier, "but the procurator
humoreth the Jews and will set up no crosses in the
city. The day may come when we will nail them in their
temple and set up there an image of Jupiter. They
troubled Pontius mightily when we did but carry our
eagles to the temple gate, as if one god were not as good
as another. What care I for gods!"</p>

<p>Loudly rang again the piercing shrieks while he was
speaking, and his hard face widened into a grim smile,
as if the sounds pleased him. But Lysias shuddered and
his blood ran cold, and he wheeled away to gallop out of
hearing of those terrible outcries.</p>

<p>"No Roman may be crucified," he exclaimed. "These
are not Romans. To them all other men are less than
brutes. I will watch that captain of the temple; but
whither should I flee from the pursuit of a procurator's
executioner?"</p>

<p>Under such fear as this dwelt all who were governed
by the servants of Cæsar, and yet it was said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
common people were more sure of justice than from any
other rulers if they remained quiet and paid all taxes
without murmuring.</p>

<p>"I will risk all!" shouted Lysias, "if I may but once
more look into the blue eyes of my Sapphira, for I know
she loveth me!"</p>

<p>The sun went down as he rode, and the shadows came,
and through the shadows he galloped on, but now and
then it seemed to him as if the shrieks from Golgotha
were ringing warningly in his ears.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXII" id="XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Mob of Samaria.</small></span></h2>


<p>The city of Jezreel was for Caius of Thessalonica and
his train but a resting place for a night. After leaving
behind its towers and the valley of battles, at the side of
which it seemed to be posted as a sentinel, Ulric the Jarl
himself was satisfied with the speed of the going which
brought him to Samaria.</p>

<p>Here, also, as they drew near, the Saxons noted well
the fortifications.</p>

<p>"These walls are old," said one. "Those of Tiberias
are newer and better. I care not for walls. Better is it to
fight in the open field, where swordsmen may come together,
shield to shield, in a fair combat."</p>

<p>Tostig the Red heard, and he shouted loudly:</p>

<p>"O jarl, not walls! Rather would I have a good keel
like <i>The Sword</i> than any fort. Towers and walls rest
where they are builded, but a ship may sail into new seas.
I am hungry for the sea!"</p>

<p>"I like not the land at all!" said Knud the Bear.
"Never again may I be found so far from the rush of
waves. I am minded to seek me a keel ere long. I
think we shall all die if we may not again see the Northland."</p>

<p>He did but speak for all. While they had been inactive
on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and even more after
setting out as if to find new adventures, the vikings had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
returned in their hearts to their old manner of living.
They had thought continually of the sea and of ships.
They had talked together of the cruise of <i>The Sword</i> and
of all the strange things which had befallen them by the
way in which they came to this country. They had also
told many tales of the great deeds of sea kings, but there
had been no minstrel or saga woman with them to sing
them a saga or to play for them upon a harp. Often,
also, did their conversings deal with the Northland itself
in its summer beauty. They longed for the high mountains
and the shadowy coolness of the fiords, and for the
faces of men and of women and of children on the shores
and about the houses. There is ever a kind of sickness
which cometh upon brave men in the thinking of such
thoughts and in the talking of such remembrances afar.
So these vikings, who were all that remained of the
mighty crew of <i>The Sword</i>, were not only weary at heart,
but almost sick in body.</p>

<p>"A keel?" said Wulf the Skater to Knud. "Thou
wilt find thee a keel? Wert thou in thine own seas now
thou wouldst find them closed against thee. Beautiful
would be the ice to look upon. But I think I could make
me good skates and reach the fiords over the floes."</p>

<p>So said other Saxons, and they did but look listlessly
at the walls of Samaria.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Caius from his chariot, "come thou
hither to me. I have a word for thee."</p>

<p>Ulric rode to the side of the chariot.</p>

<p>"What aileth thy men," asked the centurion, "that their
faces are so cloudy? Are they discontented?"</p>

<p>"Not with thee, O noble Caius," laughed Ulric, "but
they are ill at ease on horseback and in peace. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
would rather fight for thee than travel like pleasure-seekers.
One man is ever afraid that, if this continueth, he
may die in his bed and go to Hel instead of to Valhalla."</p>

<p>Stern yet pleasant was the countenance of the centurion.</p>

<p>"I understand thy men," he said. "Let them be posted
in the doorway of the house where I abide this night. I
have no others here whom I may trust, and this is a city
of the enemies of the procurator."</p>

<p>"Thou mayest sleep safely," said Ulric. "I will myself
keep that house."</p>

<p>"Thy men could not be bribed," said Caius. "I know
that of them."</p>

<p>"They have too many coins already," said Ulric. "But
I bade them keep all and spend them at Jerusalem. No
man need offer them any more. As to treachery, let thine
enemy speak of that to Tostig the Red, but first let the
seax of Tostig be taken from him."</p>

<p>"I will leave it at his belt," said Caius, "and he may
strike with it in such a case. But be not thou overhasty
with a man of rank, for thou wilt be held accountable."</p>

<p>"I will be prudent," said Ulric; "but how is it with thy
legionaries? If they are on post, is it not life and death
with them?"</p>

<p>"Men have died suddenly," said Caius, "with a legionary
motionless at the outer door. He stirred not, being
as a pillar of wood. Thy men will be free, and will act
as if they were hunters of game instead of statues. Thy
head is as good as thy hand."</p>

<p>"I will keep thee," said Ulric, "and I would that the
men might have a chance to draw a sword or throw a
spear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>"They will not," said Caius. "There are no men in
Samaria who would trifle with such a guard as thy
Saxons. Think not but what I will remember thee for
this matter."</p>

<p>The jarl reined away his horse, thinking deeply.</p>

<p>"O Caius, do I not know that thou art as other
Romans? So soon as thou art done with us thou wouldst
give us to the lions and look on while we were torn, being
amused. Soft words are well enough, however, and thou
art better than are some of thy people."</p>

<p>For the jarl grew crafty under the burden of leadership,
and he seemed older than when he stood with Hilda
on the shore of the North sea looking at her runes upon
the sand.</p>

<p>A large house like a castle near the eastern wall of the
city was assigned to so great a man as Caius, but he went
the next day to a feast, being entertained by the governor
and other notables, among whom were certain lords of
Herod's household.</p>

<p>"It will be late when I return," he said to Ulric at his
going. "I will send for thee."</p>

<p>"Not so," said the jarl. "I will come without thy
sending. There have been tumults in Samaria since the
sun's rising. There will be good spears around thy
chariot."</p>

<p>"Do as thou wilt, O jarl," said Caius. "I fear no
tumult and I have good attendance."</p>

<p>"Hast thou indeed a guard, and is it not from this
man, the governor?" said Ulric. "Leave thou such matters
to me, I pray thee, that thou mayest at all reach
Jerusalem."</p>

<p>The chariot of the centurion rolled away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
palace gate, and with it rode a score of mounted soldiers
sent by the governor as a guard of honor for his distinguished
guest. Hardly were they out of sight, however,
before the Saxons sprang to their feet at a sudden
summons.</p>

<p>"Spears and shields!" commanded the jarl. "Let every
man look well to his weapons and to his armor. Be ye
all ready to march, but first let every man come to me and
report whatever things he hath heard or seen this day."</p>

<p>One had this thing to speak of and another that thing,
but for the greater part it all seemed to be of little worth.
Their eyes, too, had been better than their ears in a city
of an unknown tongue. Nevertheless, the jarl said to
Wulf the Skater:</p>

<p>"Thou hast scented this danger, then, thou keen old
hunter? So is it with me, only that I better understand
sayings uttered in my hearing, and some who spoke
believed that I was as a stone wall, having no ears. They
were, therefore, careless. I will say to thee that the
soldiers who are now with Caius are all from this new
legion wherein Julius was for a while the chief officer.
It is for our interest that Caius may suffer no harm.
Moreover, we may have some good fighting, and that is
worth while."</p>

<p>"Thank the gods!" interrupted Knud the Bear. "Now
may I the more comfortably eat my supper. It is well
to have a thoughtful jarl."</p>

<p>A city by itself was Samaria, as it had been during long
centuries. They who called themselves Samaritans bore
deadly hatred to all Jews, but could not prevent them
from entering the city and transacting business there,
although they could have no dealings with the Samari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>tans.
All other nationalities came and went freely, and
here was a gathering of the offscourings of the earth.
The Jews risk all perils for the sake of traffic, and they
had in this matter the protection of the Roman laws.
Nevertheless, these hatreds were the root of many
troubles, and from time to time there had been bloody
riots to be suppressed by the legionaries with but small
care upon whom their swords might fall. It might have
been trusted that a Roman of rank like Caius would be
as safe in Samaria as in Jerusalem or in Rome, and so he
would have been but for the intrigues of those who were
greater than he. Herod Archelaus, to whom Judea and
Samaria had fallen by the will of his father, Herod the
Great, had forfeited his realm to the Romans and it was
now ruled by Pontius the Spearman. Both the Herod of
the Black Castle, whose legacy had been Galilee and some
provinces beyond the Dead Sea, and Herod Antipas, who
had inherited large districts at the north and east of
Galilee, were plotting to overthrow Pontius and also to
defeat each other. The favor of Cæsar was the path to
increase of power not only for them, but for Roman
plotters such as Julius, and there were intrigues against
them all at Rome itself. The strifes of those who fought
continually for the spoils of Roman conquests were ever
records of bloodshed, and no man's life was safe. To be
a great Roman was to walk on toward destruction.</p>

<p>Splendid was the feast to which Caius went at the
palace of the governor of Samaria, but he was wary and
he did not become drunken. Long reclined the guests
on the couches at the tables, to be served with all the
delicacies of the earth. Also there were dancers and
mimes and musicians. But the end came. Some were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
to abide in the palace, some were to go to their houses
near, in the city. The chariot of Caius waited for him,
but as he and his slaves walked out at the main portal
they heard a sound of trumpets and great outcries of a
multitude.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said Caius. "I heard that the rabble
had risen against the Jews. Let the legionaries form in
the road. Drive on!"</p>

<p>He spoke scornfully, but the outcries were near, and
now came a great rush of men, of whom many were
armed. In front of the governor's palace was an open
space, into which the multitude was pouring, but from
the opposite direction came forward another throng of
men. In the foreranks of these was a small man in
armor, with the visor of his helmet closed.</p>

<p>"Yonder is the chariot of Caius," he said. "Wait only
till the Iberians charge. Then slay him and flee. Let the
blame fall on the Jews and the Samaritans."</p>

<p>Two score were the legionaries, and it was the governor,
standing upon the steps of the palace portal, who
shouted to them:</p>

<p>"Charge ye the mob lest they hinder the going of my
guest. Slay them! O most noble Caius, I send out also
quickly my own guards and servants. Thou art safe!"</p>

<p>If this were indeed the craft of the governor, it was
well hidden, for the soldiers went forward smiting all in
their way, and armed men from the palace went also.
By this very charge, however, the chariot would have
been left alone save for Caius and his charioteers and a
few mounted bondsmen. Not in the silken robes of a
man at a feast was the centurion at this moment, nevertheless.
The robes were to be seen in the light of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
torches, but they covered good mail and armor, and suddenly
upon his head was a helmet and in his hand a
pilum.</p>

<p>"Treachery!" he shouted. "The jarl was correct! O
for my Saxons!"</p>

<p>"Here, O Caius!" loudly responded a voice from
among the shadows of the palace front. "Halt not thy
chariot, but drive slowly. We have abundant javelins."</p>

<p>The torches held by the bondsmen flared in swinging,
more being lighted, and past them seemed to go dull red
flashes, but these were the bright blades of Syrian darts
obtained by Ulric for this business. Strong were the
arms hurling, and the darts were better than arrows at so
short a distance.</p>

<p>"Jupiter Tonans!" roared Caius. "I have a sheaf of
them here in the chariot, for myself and my charioteers.
Wise is the Saxon, and he provided them for me!"</p>

<p>A good thrower was he, and some who had stealthily
crept on too nearly were smitten as they sprang forward.
Then came the charge which had been purposed across
the open space, but between its front and the chariot was
a wall of Saxons, in full armor, shouting with the fierce
joy of battle.</p>

<p>Down went the small leader, cloven to the jaws as if
his helmet were of wood. Down went his companions
rapidly, while the battle laughter of the vikings rang
derisively in their ears.</p>

<p>The other multitude the legionaries were slaughtering
pitilessly, but the command of the governor had been to
follow, and the soldiers came not back at once.</p>

<p>"Slay! Slay!" shouted Caius. "I come!"</p>

<p>"Come not!" replied Ulric. "Abide where thou art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
and press on to thy house. We will keep these wolves at
bay."</p>

<p>"A fight and I not in it?" said Caius, angrily. "Commandest
thou me?"</p>

<p>"In the fight I am jarl!" said Ulric. "I am answerable
for thy head. Drive on!"</p>

<p>"Thou art right!" said Caius, justly. "On, O
charioteer! Obey thou the Saxon. I forgot that he is a
prince and a captain among his own people. I will make
him a Roman yet. He should not be a barbarian."</p>

<p>Hardly might any less than a king, nor even a king
except at great cost and for policy, obtain Roman citizenship,
but this was the meaning of the words of Caius.</p>

<p>Then an arrow flew and struck him upon the left arm,
wounding him; but he mentioned it not, for he saw that
the charge was broken and that the Saxons came to march
with the chariot.</p>

<p>"Not one of them is missing," he thought. "So much
for broad shields and good mail. The rioters had
weapons, but no armor, and they were slain as cattle.
This arm of mine is but scratched."</p>

<p>"On!" commanded the jarl, to his men. "I heard the
centurion say he is wounded. O Caius, how art thou?"</p>

<p>"A sting on my arm," replied Caius. "We shall soon
be at the house. This is naught."</p>

<p>"Let me see it speedily," said Ulric. "I have picked up
an arrow with a grooved head. Thou knowest what that
meaneth."</p>

<p>"Haste! Haste!" shouted Caius. "This thing is of
Herod, the jackal! I am lost."</p>

<p>But the tumult had been stricken to quiet and the
ground was strewn with the dead. Now as they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
there came swiftly armed horsemen of the governor and
behind these marched the Iberian legionaries. No visible
fault might be charged by Caius upon his host of the
feast. Not far was it to his place of abiding, but when
the chariot halted there he sprang down and entered in
a gloomy silence, followed by the jarl.</p>

<p>"Home, now," commanded the officer of the legionaries.
"Our duty is done."</p>

<p>Back with them went all servants of the governor, but
Caius was in an inner room removing his armor.</p>

<p>"I wore no armlets," he said, "lest the governor might
see them. The arrow went past my shield while I threw
a spear. Thou hast done well, O Saxon chief. But for
thee I had been murdered. This is a small wound."</p>

<p>"I will suck it for thee before I bind it," said Ulric.
"Then watch thou if it beginneth to burn, but set thou
out hence before dawn."</p>

<p>"That will I this hour," said Caius, and orders went
forth.</p>

<p>Great was the declared wrath of the governor of
Samaria, for he came himself to inquire concerning the
welfare of his guest. Not to him was anything said of a
groove in an arrow wherein might be pressed some deadly
juice, and he returned to his palace a seeming friend of
Caius, complaining bitterly of the Jews and Samaritans,
more of whom he threatened to slaughter for this night's
business.</p>

<p>Ulric cared for his men. They had cuts and bruises
which they made light of, but among them was no arrow
wound. So light a missile would have been stopped by a
leathern hauberk, and all their mail was of the highest
temper of steel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will ride soon," he told them. "Be ready to
mount and leave this place of thieves."</p>

<p>"I like it well!" exclaimed Knud the Bear. "It was not
a hard fight, as if these fellows had been Danes or Northmen,
but I cleft many skulls and I think Wulf the Skater
killed a score of them. Tostig was unlucky, and Ven, the
son of Gerta, slew more Samaritans that he did."</p>

<p>"He did not," said Wulf. "Thy counting is not good.
And I slew two men in armor also."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The House of Pontius the Spearman.</small></span></h2>


<p>The road from Samaria to Jerusalem hath many
windings and there are hills to weary the wayfarer.
Climbing one of these slowly was the chariot of Caius
of Thessalonica. He was lying heavily upon the back
seat, as one to whom this journey had become an insupportable
burden.</p>

<p>"This long day draweth to its close, O jarl," he said to
the horseman nearest him on the right. "The roads are
worse to pass than were those of yesterday. We are now
on the level near the ridge of the Mount of Olives. Soon
we may see the city. My arm burneth and it is swelling."</p>

<p>"I would we were already with thy learned physician,"
replied Ulric. "Be of better cheer. I know little of such
matters, but I think thou doest well. I will offer sacrifices
for thee in this temple of the Jews. Hast thou ever done
aught against their god? He is revengeful."</p>

<p>"I have not harmed him," said Caius. "I have not
slain Jews. Do as thou wilt, for at this time there is no
other god in Jerusalem. I will pay for thy oxen and
Pontius will command the priests to offer them upon his
altar. Thinkest thou, O Saxon, that any god hath power
to heal the wound made by a poisoned arrow?"</p>

<p>"That I know not," said Ulric. "I have often wondered
much what the gods may do. One of them healed
me of my hurts from the tiger of Julius. Such a god
might cast out a poison. He casteth out demons and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
healed a leper. He opened the eyes of a blind man. I
would that he were now in Jerusalem and that thou
mightest look into his face. Also I must offer sacrifices
of thanks for that matter. It is not right to obtain a
gift from any god and then not to keep faith with him.
A god should be dealt with as if he were a brave warrior."</p>

<p>"Well for thee!" exclaimed Caius. "I would indeed
that he were here instead of in Galilee. No god may heal
aught so far away, and as for this god of the Jews, they
will not that a Roman enter his temple."</p>

<p>"Ben Ezra told me of the temple," said Ulric, "that a
court is prepared into which all may come. There only
will I enter. It is not well to anger priests in their temple,
for they know the ways of their god and we know them
not."</p>

<p>"Thou art young, but thou art cunning," said Caius.
"But I have a great fear concerning this wound in my
arm. It is not like any other, and I have been wounded
often. A strange thing is poison. I have considered why
the gods make such a thing and why they put it into the
teeth of serpents. They are evil!"</p>

<p>"A god may need a serpent as thou needest a spear,"
said Ulric. "It is plain to me. If I were a god, I would
make what I required for my errands. So do they work
with winds and seas and rocks, and with thunders and
with plagues of many kinds. No man getteth away from
them if they have aught against him. Anger not the
gods, for they are powerful and they are cunning."</p>

<p>"As thou hast said," replied Caius, gloomily, "I have
spoken against them at times, and now they have reached
me with this Syrian arrow from the quiver of Herod the
jackal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Odin!" suddenly exclaimed the jarl; for the overwearied
horse under him stood still without a pull of the
rein, and before the eyes of the Saxons was the City of
the Great King, the Holy City, Jerusalem the Beautiful.</p>

<p>Deep is the valley of Jehoshaphat, through which runneth
the brook Kidron under its many bridges and between
its gardens and palaces. Beyond this valley, as the
whole company stood still to admire, they saw the mighty
walls of the city, high and white, and the castles and the
towers, but beyond and above all these, in the bright light
of the declining sun, they saw the glories of the temple
which was accounted one of the seven wonders of the
world.</p>

<p>"It is Asgard!" said Ulric, thoughtfully, "and I see
the temple of a god that hath power on earth to heal
wounds and to give sight, and to whom demons give
obedience. I think he is not as are the gods of the North,
and I will ask this son of his more about him."</p>

<p>But the Saxons who were halted with him said one to
another:</p>

<p>"We have come out into the world far enough. We
will see this one city and we will do somewhat of fighting
perhaps. But then we will find a keel, or take one,
and we will return to the Northland, whether the jarl
goeth with us or not. The winter of this land is warm,
not cold, and we may not abide it. We will go into our
own fiords as the ice cometh out, seeing we may not get
there sooner."</p>

<p>So strong is homesickness, and so it will change the
hearts and the wills of brave men.</p>

<p>At that hour a youth sat in a vaulted chamber of a
great building upon one of the hills of Jerusalem. Around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
him the furniture was good, but somewhat plain, and
there were weapons and armor of many kinds scattered
here and there. In a corner was a couch, and there were
chairs and tables, and on the tables unlighted lamps.</p>

<p>"I do know," he said, "that Pontius the Spearman is
in the city. Why doth he not send for me? I am not in
a prison, yet I am not permitted to go out into the city
since I returned from Cæsarea. The procurator cannot
think that I know aught more than my messages, nor fear
lest I should betray him. Why, then, am I shut up in
this chamber of the castle?"</p>

<p>Little remembered the haughty procurator of so small
a matter as a young Greek messenger for whom he had
no present need. Somewhere among the household this
Lysias was sure to be awaiting a summons, and there
were weighty matters on hand. One was before him
pressingly in the hall of audience, for he himself stood
there angrily reading a written scroll which had been
brought to him.</p>

<p>"The high priest and the eagles once more!" he exclaimed.
"This god of the Jews! What is he to me?
I anger him not. Little he careth for the standards of the
cohorts. Go thou! Tell Caiaphas it shall be as he willeth,
and I will send him oxen for his sacrifices. The
tribute gatherers have brought me even too many horned
cattle, and his god may have them."</p>

<p>A dignified man, long-robed, gray-bearded, solemn-faced,
who stood before him, bowed low, responding:</p>

<p>"I hear thee, most noble Pontius. I will bear to the
high priest thy answer. It shall be to us as a promise
from Cæsar. May the blessing of Jehovah of Hosts be
upon him and thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go!" said Pontius, petulantly. "If he cannot do better
for the Romans than he hath done for the Jews, my
oxen are but wasted."</p>

<p>Lowly bowed the Jewish noble, but there was pride in
his obeisance, and as he went out at the gate he muttered:</p>

<p>"The gift of Jehovah to these heathen would be the
coming of Messiah the Prince and the slaughter of their
legions in the valley that is before Jezreel until the blood
should be as a river to wade horses in."</p>

<p>"What thinkest thou, Cornelius," said the procurator
to a soldier of noble presence who stood near him;
"must we yield to these dogs forever, with their continual
turmoil?"</p>

<p>"They have their god," said Cornelius. "I have read
much about him. He is gone from them for a while, but
he hath promised to come back again. I think we should
make him one of the gods of Rome and set up his image
in the Pantheon with that of Jupiter."</p>

<p>"That were good policy," said Pontius, "and it would
leave these priests of his nothing more to complain of.
They are a pestilent nest of fault-finders and some of
them get to the ear of Cæsar, doing us mischief; for they
are crafty serpents."</p>

<p>"I fear God," said Cornelius. "We are but men and
we see but little, while the eyes of God are everywhere."</p>

<p>"Go thou to Joppa, then," said Pontius, "and let no
man pass out of the fort without thy knowledge. Thou
keepest the gate. Keep it well."</p>

<p>Soldierly, friendly, was the parting word of Cornelius
to his commander, but he was a free Roman and there
was no servility in his courtesy, nor was there any fear.</p>

<p>"Him, also, I may trust," said Pontius, "but O for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
coming of Caius of Thessalonica! I will see, also, Lysias,
the Greek, and I would that Ben Ezra were returned from
his cave in Carmel with his treasures. I will let him keep
a part of them because I have further use for him before
he dieth."</p>

<p>In the strong inner chamber of the procurator's castle
Lysias walked slowly up and down chafing at his imprisonment,
but his eyes glanced hither and thither and
they were watchful.</p>

<p>"What!" he suddenly exclaimed, low-voiced. "Is the
corridor door ajar? Would it be my death warrant to
look out into the corridor? I am under no command not
to look, but I may well be prudent where there are so
many sharp swords."</p>

<p>The door was but slightly opened, as if he who last
passed through had shut it carelessly; but there are traps
in prison houses, and Lysias hesitated, going to listen at
the narrow crevice, but not laying a hand upon wall or
door.</p>

<p>"No sound," he thought. "I may open and close
again. Who knoweth what may be here? I offend no
order of any officer."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he trembled as he obeyed the strong impulse
that was in him. A step forward and he was in
the corridor. It was lofty, its floor was of pictured tiling,
and it was lighted by windows at each end. Into it came
another vaulted passage three fathoms away, and he went
swiftly to that opening.</p>

<p>"Vast is this palace," he was thinking, but at the next
beating of his heart he went forward with a great bound,
for the music of a woman's voice in a gay song fell upon
his ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is here!" he exclaimed. "Now I care not if I
die, so I but see her."</p>

<p>Wide open was a door into this second passage and
through it poured the song, accompanied by the touching
of a small harp. It was a love song, and he heard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now cometh he, my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the land beyond the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fair wind blowing knoweth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That it bringeth him to me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Sapphira! O my beloved! I am here!"</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and the lyre fell from her hand.
O she was beautiful, in her sudden astonishment and
fear, but he who came toward her with open arms seemed
even more beautiful than she, for his face was radiant
and his eyes were a flame of fire.</p>

<p>"Sapphira?"</p>

<p>"O rash one! Thou art lost! What am I to thee any
more? Am I not the slave of the procurator of Judea?
Thou art not my Lysias; thou art but a rider of horses."</p>

<p>In her face was a great struggle of pain, nevertheless,
and in his was a whiteness, for he fell upon the floor and
lay there moaning.</p>

<p>"Foolish boy!" she said, stooping over him. "I love
thee, but I am not now thine, nor can I be. The past is
dead, and the gods have bidden us eternal separation.
Destroy me not and destroy not thyself. Go lest the
sword find thee here! The scourge is close to thee, and
sudden death both for thee and me."</p>

<p>"I care not for the scourge or the sword," said Lysias,
slowly rising and gazing at her. "I care only for thee,
O false one! Hast thou utterly changed away from me?"</p>

<p>"What I was that I am not," she said. "What thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
art thou knowest. Art thou mad, also, to cast thyself
against the power of Pontius? Leave me lest I call for
help! I will not die on thy account. I love life, and life
is full of love for such as I am. What need have I of
thee, O lost lover?"</p>

<p>Anger was in her eyes now, and greater fear, for that
which she said was true.</p>

<p>"Kiss me!" he said, faintly, "and I will go. The gods
have abandoned me!"</p>

<p>Then stepped she forward and kissed him on the lips
and a spasm shook him from head to foot, shaking her
also.</p>

<p>"Let thy love die within thee," she said, "and trouble
me no more, for I live happily in this palace, where all
are my friends. Make me not thine enemy, for in this
thou art a robber."</p>

<p>"That am I," he murmured. "I will go. I came far
and risked all to see thee. I knew nothing concerning
women. Now that I know thee, what thou art, I have
no need of thee. Love will die, for all else is dead. Sing
thou thy song, but be sure that all thy roses will wither
on thy bosom."</p>

<p>"Cursest thou me?" she exclaimed. "Beware what
thou sayest! I have power!"</p>

<p>"As a caged leopard hath power, so hast thou," said
Lysias. "I leave thee. Be thou a slave, for that is all
that is in thee"&mdash;and he was gone.</p>

<p>She stood and looked at the doorway by which he had
departed, and her lips were without color and her hand
was on her bosom.</p>

<p>"What is this?" she asked. "Did I love him better
than I knew? Was I too much in fear that I sent him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
from me? One cometh who would slay him. It is best
that he should go lest he should die. Women must be
prudent, but this pain is great. I did love him. O that
he had not come again, for before he came I was happy.
O ye gods, what shall I do? O beautiful Aphrodite, help
me, for thou knowest love!"</p>

<p>In the corridor lingered Lysias listening, and then he
walked on, staggering as he went.</p>

<p>"O woman! woman!" he whispered. "What is woman
and what is man? She is changed and I change not. I
cannot hate her, as I thought I could, now she hath
spoken. I will wait cunningly, for I am sure that in this
palace is one who calleth for my knife or for a spear
thrust. I will find him."</p>

<p>In a moment more he was in his own place, still leaving
its door ajar, as at the first, but he began to search among
the weapons and the armor in the room, finding a small,
sharp blade with an ivory handle, and hiding it in his
bosom.</p>

<p>"It will do," he said, "but I would I might wear
mail."</p>

<p>At that he was stooping over some fine steelwork and
he heard a step behind him. It was a crafty thought
which bade him continue his speech.</p>

<p>"The procurator knoweth me only as a postboy," he
said. "I might serve him better in mail. He hath not
many who would be true to him as I would. There are
those who are false, but I could bring him a good sword
in a hand he might surely trust."</p>

<p>"O Greek!" said a deep, stern voice. "What is this
that thou sayest? Put on the mail!"</p>

<p>"O most noble Pontius!" exclaimed Lysias, turning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
but lifting the armor. "Thou didst not send for me,
therefore I came not."</p>

<p>"Speak not," said Pontius, "save to tell me all that thou
hast seen and heard here and at Joppa and at Cæsarea. I
have a work for thee."</p>

<p>Lysias told all save his meeting with Sapphira, and the
procurator listened.</p>

<p>"Thou hast ears and thou hast eyes," he said at last.
"I set thee free of all other service but this that I now tell
thee. Thou wilt have another abiding place than this,
but thou wilt come and go freely among my servants,
being known to them as my messenger whom none may
hinder. Now hath one come from the Damascus gate
saying that my friend Caius of Thessalonica draweth
near, and with him his Saxon gladiators. He is wounded,
and my physician meeteth him. Go thou. Hear all. See
all. Report to me of his swordsmen.</p>

<p>"Now hearken! Among the female slaves of my wife
is one in whom is a peril, for she is fair. For women I
care not, but there are men who are fools before bright
eyes. In the banquet room and in the balconies get thou
speech with this Sapphira. She will be spoken to by my
wife that she may hide nothing from thee lest she die in
the arena. Judea and Samaria are worth more to me
than is the blood of one fair serpent. Come!"</p>

<p>Lysias now stood before the procurator in mail and
helmet, girded with a light sword and bearing a silver-gilded
buckler. It was the arms and armor of the Syrian
mercenaries of Pontius, but as of an officer among them,
ordered to duty at the palace.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt go on foot to the Damascus gate," said
Pontius. "The physician waiteth Caius at his house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Deliver this scroll to Caius and remain with his company
until thou canst bring me exact tidings concerning his
wound."</p>

<p>"O most noble Pontius," said Lysias, "I pray thee permission
to say this word."</p>

<p>"Say on!" said the Spearman.</p>

<p>"Only in being true to thee have I any hope of life, for
thy enemies are my enemies. I also will at times to attend
at the school of Gamaliel, as I told thee."</p>

<p>"That is thy value to me," said Pontius. "Wert thou
any man's bondservant, or wert thou other than a youth,
a scholar of Gamaliel, I would have no use for thee. All
they of his manner of teaching are handicraftsmen, even
if they are rich. What is thy work?"</p>

<p>"I am a shaper of arrows," said Lysias, "and I know
the making of a bow. Thou mayest yet require to have a
sharp arrow sent surely to a mark of thy choosing."</p>

<p>"Say thou no more!" commanded the procurator.
"Thou art wise to preserve thy head. Only a fool throweth
away his life. Go!"</p>

<p>For they had walked out along the passage and before
them was a gate of the palace. It was not the great gate,
but even here were armed legionaries, and their officer
and others with him took note of Lysias and of the
manner of his sending.</p>

<p>"He is the trusted messenger of the procurator," said
one. "I heard of him from the captain of the temple.
When he hath borne many messages we shall cease to
see him."</p>

<p>Lysias passed on down the steep street in his brilliant
armor as one having a shadow of authority, but his heart
was bitter within him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am to see her again," he murmured. "I would she
were dead and I dead with her. I will but live to strike
this unknown one, even if I stab him with a blade of
Pontius. But I must be cunning with these Saxons. Do
I not know what manner of pirates they are? Not among
any other crew, I think, shall I find men so tall and so
strong as are my old comrades from <i>The Sword</i>. Their
jarl would be a prince of gladiators, but I am not glad
that he and his come now to Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Away behind him in the palace, in the room where he
had met her, sat Sapphira.</p>

<p>"What is this?" she exclaimed. "Did I not see him
walking with the procurator as one walketh with a near
friend? Is he, then, more than a horse boy? Is he an
officer of the palace, and greater than I? Now am I
indeed in pain, for I have need of friends. O love! Why
was I cruel to thee? Come again, O my beloved! My
Lysias! I will tell thee that I am not changed! Will he
return if I call him? He will, for I am beautiful. I am
favored by Aphrodite. She will make him bend to me
as I will. It was but for a moment, and I was in fear.
None must see me this day. I will go at once as if I were
summoned by the wife of the procurator. Woe to any
who shall hinder me."</p>

<p>She caught up and threw over her head a veil and over
her body a flowing robe of silk embroidered with needlework.
Then, as if fear hastened her, she flitted away
along the main corridor and disappeared.</p>

<p>With all honor did the captain of the Damascus gate
of Jerusalem receive Caius of Thessalonica, the friend of
Pontius the Spearman. The chariot halted before the
gate and in it sat the stern Roman centurion, giving no
external token of a wound or of suffering.</p>

<p>"O noble Caius," said the captain, after his first greeting,
"I have this, also, for thee from the procurator, that
his physician, who is also thine, hath gone before thee to
thy house. May the gods give him both skill and success."</p>

<p>"I thank the procurator and thee, also," said Caius. "I
will now drive on."</p>

<p>"A moment, O most noble Caius," interrupted the
officer of the guard. "A messenger even now. He is
from the procurator."</p>

<p>There was no stir among the mounted swordsmen who
rode before and behind the chariot, but they sent quick
glances to each other as their eyes fell upon this messenger.</p>

<p>"Silence, O jarl," he had said in Greek to Ulric as he
drew near him. "I shall go with thee speedily. I thank
the gods that I now see thee again. I can do many good
things for thee and thine. I pray thee bid them, also, to
be as if we were strangers."</p>

<p>"They need no bidding," said Ulric. "Hael to thee."</p>

<p>No further word did either of them speak, but Lysias
waited at the side of the chariot while Caius read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
parchment epistle. It was but brief, and when it was
ended the centurion said to Lysias:</p>

<p>"Go thou and come again. I will answer for thee to
Pontius. Say that I bid him be with me within the hour
lest evil come. Haste! On thy head! O charioteer,
drive to my house! On, O jarl!"</p>

<p>"Behold," thought Lysias, "I am in a sore strait.
Pontius will scourge me! But I will run."</p>

<p>A swift runner was he, even with the mail upon him,
and at the gate of the procurator's palace he halted to
draw breath.</p>

<p>"In! In!" exclaimed the officer of the portal. "I will
announce thee. The procurator giveth a feast, but I
may go to him. This must be some strange errand!"</p>

<p>"The gods be with thee!" said Lysias. "Tell him!"</p>

<p>It was but a few terrible moments, full of fear for the
young Greek, and he stood in an anteroom before the
stern Spearman.</p>

<p>"What did I bid thee?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Slay thou me if thou wilt, most noble procurator,"
bravely responded Lysias, "but Caius of Thessalonica
sendeth thee greeting and these words: 'Be thou with me
within the hour lest evil come.' I beg thee, O Pontius,
let me say this much more: for I heard him whisper,
'Lest he give his power into the hand of him of the Black
Castle and his neck to the headsman of Cæsar.' I have
not at all disobeyed thee, O Pontius. He bade me return
to his house for another commandment."</p>

<p>"Be thou there on his arrival and I will count it thy
strict obedience," said Pontius. "Thou art not a legionary,
nor under the law of the legion. I think thou servest
me well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>Away ran Lysias murmuring: "So narrow is the
measure between Roman favor and Roman vengeance!
He may die ere I risk his wrath again."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not easy for one of the great to depart
from a feast whereat governors and senators and
princes are reclining, and Pontius went in to pay the
duty of host to his many guests, so that Lysias was in no
peril concerning his errand.</p>

<p>The chariot had reached its halting place and Caius
had walked into his house, upheld somewhat by his pride,
but more by the arm of Ulric, the son of Brander.</p>

<p>Already the physician had examined the wound made
by the Syrian grooved arrow.</p>

<p>"O Saxon," he asked, "thou didst suck this poison well
and quickly?"</p>

<p>Ulric did but nod his head.</p>

<p>"Then know thou, my lord Caius," said the man of
skill, "that but for thy swordsman thou wert already
dead. I will do what I can for thee, but it will be long
before thou wilt bear thine armor. This wound must be
neither bandaged nor closed, but washed only and kept
open. Saxon, give me thy sharpest blade."</p>

<p>"It is my seax," said Ulric, drawing it. "What am I
to do?"</p>

<p>"Cut into this hard swelling," said the physician. "Cut
the depth of two finger breadths and withdraw thy blade."</p>

<p>"Cut!" said Caius. "Am I afraid of an edge?"</p>

<p>"So bidden, I will cut," said Ulric, and the sword
point went into the swollen arm.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the physician. "With that green
corruption spurteth out much evil. Widen the cut. Caius
is saved. I will put into the gash an ointment that I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
bring. It is well for thee, O Caius, that thy strong
swordsman is thy trusty friend. I go."</p>

<p>Behind them, by express authority, now stood Lysias,
listening, and he said:</p>

<p>"Most noble Caius, this is my command from the procurator.
I must go to him."</p>

<p>"Tell thou him the saying of the physician," said Caius.
"Tell him, also, that I change not my greeting. He must
come."</p>

<p>Again went Lysias, and again he stood before the procurator
telling all that he had heard and seen.</p>

<p>"Pause thou here a moment," said Pontius. "I would
have speech with my wife."</p>

<p>Still as a statue stood the young Greek, and none who
came or went dared ask him whence he came, but suddenly
an arm was around his neck and a kiss was upon
his cheek.</p>

<p>"I am here, beloved, but I may not linger. I will see
thee often. I am still thy Sapphira."</p>

<p>He stirred not, spoke not, nor did he turn to see, but
there was a grating of teeth.</p>

<p>"O Lysias! O love!"</p>

<p>"Speak not of that which is dead," he said to her. "Go
thou thy way. This is no place for the foolishness of unfaithful
women. I will indeed meet thee again, but thou
art a slave and I am a free warrior. Go!"</p>

<p>White was now the face of Sapphira and her lips were
quivering, but she whispered:</p>

<p>"Scorn me not! I was frightened, and so I was cruel.
I do love thee; and thou wilt need me in this place, which
is as a spider's web. I go. Follow me not!"</p>

<p>"Follow thee?" laughed Lysias, scornfully. "I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
follow thee from far, but now I am as a weapon in the
hand of the procurator. I shall serve not thee, but him."</p>

<p>"Ha!" muttered one who heard. "This is, then, the
trusted one. Him we must slay."</p>

<p>Well for that speaker if his lips had been closed, for in
the shadow behind him stood Pontius the Spearman.</p>

<p>"They who will not betray me must die?" he thought
within himself. "Then do I now know one mark at which
my Greek may send his sharpest arrow and be guiltless.
He may slay this Iberian swine with his own hand."</p>

<p>For the mutterer was a guest who had risen from a
table, and he was one who had been an officer of Herod's
household, but was now pretending to be an enemy of the
cunning tetrarch, the jackal of the Black Castle.</p>

<p>The guest returned to his reclining, and Sapphira had
vanished as a lamp that goeth out, but the procurator
came forward.</p>

<p>"Say to Caius that I come. Abide thou in his house
this night and on the morrow until I send for thee, save
that thou mayest go in the morning to the school of
Gamaliel. Hast thou money for thy uses?"</p>

<p>"O most noble Pontius," said Lysias, "the swift ass
that was mine own is in thy stable. All baggage of mine
is in the armory room where thou didst find me. I have
gold and silver pieces enough in my pouch for this present.
I am not poor, so that what I have be not taken
from me."</p>

<p>"I will give orders in these thy matters," replied Pontius.
"He who serveth me well is rich enough. Thou
shalt have thy swift ass and such other beasts as thou
wilt. Go now. I believe thee brave and prudent. Thou
art young, too, and the girl is fair. Youth is the time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
trifling. Provide thee soon a good bow and arrows of
thine own choosing."</p>

<p>"Thanks, O noble Pontius! Thanks! I will send sure
arrows at thy bidding!" So saying, the young Greek
departed.</p>

<p>Long was the conference that night between the
Saxons and Lysias.</p>

<p>"We are little surprised," said the jarl, "for we knew
thou wert going to this place. Thou art a good fighter
and thou hast rightly taken the procurator for thy captain.
I have heard that he casteth the pilum even better
than do other Romans. I could follow such a man into
battle, knowing that he is fitted to lead. Hast thou found
thy Sapphira?"</p>

<p>"Speak not of her, O jarl," said Lysias. "Ere long
thou mayest thyself look upon her, but there is a peril in
her name at this hour."</p>

<p>"I read thy face," said Ulric. "Keep thou thine own
secret. But thou mayest say to Pontius the Spearman
that he hath no surer friend than Caius of Thessalonica."</p>

<p>"Even now they are together," replied Lysias. "The
procurator will know all that is known to thy friend, but
I fear the careless tongues of thy Saxons. They speak
to one another concerning triremes and old fights at sea.
I would they were in their North country."</p>

<p>"So would not I," said Ulric, "unless I were to sail
with them. I may not now leave this city of Jerusalem,
and to sail to the north were to sail into ice fields. We
must wait until the spring."</p>

<p>Not so thought the homesick vikings in their comfortable
lodgings in the house of Caius. Even now they
were talking of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is but a few miles to this seaport called Joppa,"
they said. "We will learn somewhat concerning the road
thither and the shipping. We are free men, with the
Middle Sea so near at hand."</p>

<p>Caius of Thessalonica slept well after his long communing
with the procurator, and when he awoke the jarl
sat near him.</p>

<p>"Thou art watchful!" exclaimed Caius. "But in
Jerusalem I am safe. I have to tell thee, however, that
thy gladiators may not abide within the walls. The
quarters for such as they are out in the valley of Jehoshaphat,
near the amphitheater. No games are going on
at this time, but there will be abundant sport in the days
after the Passover feast, when Herod cometh."</p>

<p>The jarl's brow darkened, but he said only: "So be it.
I will guide them to their place. I myself will inspect the
city and the forts and offer sacrifices, as I told thee. But
this know thou, O noble Caius, that not in this city nor in
any other is treachery dead. I fear for thee. How is
thine arm? I would see it."</p>

<p>"Thou hast knowledge of wounds, but not of poison,"
replied Caius. "Uncover it."</p>

<p>The jarl did so, and he looked thoughtfully at the sore
and then at the feverish face of the noble Roman.</p>

<p>"This man will die slowly," he thought, "but he will
die, for this wound healeth not. I will not be here when
he dieth, lest I be deemed by others only fit food for wild
beasts. So will I say to my companions."</p>

<p>"It changeth little," he said aloud to Caius. "Who
shall read a thing like this? I will go and return, but I
would my sword might be near thee if there is need of it."</p>

<p>"Go, O jarl," said Caius. "I will send for thee if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
require thee. Fulfill thy will concerning the city, for all
men may come and go. Only that thou must leave thy
weapons from thee or the legionaries will disarm thee.
The Jews, also, go unarmed."</p>

<p>"For that I have no care," said Ulric, "but it were a
sore thing for Tostig the Red, for instance, to have no
hilt near his grip."</p>

<p>"March them away quickly!" exclaimed Caius. "While
thou art known to be with me as a guard thou mayest
wear thy sword and thy mail. The rules go no further,
for there have been many tumults and much bloodshed
in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>The jarl answered not to that, but took his leave, and
not at all as a servant. Rather did it seem as if the centurion
were under his command. He went to his men,
and well pleased were they to find their quarters were to
be without the walls.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Wulf the Skater, "this is much better.
I would thou wert able now to show us our way to the
sea. We have learned much from Lysias and from others.
There is good shipping upon the coast and the right keel
might be found by brave men."</p>

<p>"Also triremes of Cæsar," replied the jarl. "The coast
is well guarded. We will wait a little."</p>

<p>Out into the streets they marched, with him at their
head, and many turned to look upon their array as they
went on to the gate. The dwellers in Jerusalem were
accustomed to seeing various kinds of armed men, but
these were unlike any others. Nevertheless, there were
devout Jews who lifted hands to curse them in the name
of Jehovah, as heathen gladiators whose presence was a
pollution of the city of God.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>
<p>The amphitheater, when they came to it, was found
to be larger than that of Tiberias, with more dens for
wild beasts and with a better and longer course for the
running of races.</p>

<p>"I have been told," said the circus servitor who guided
them, "that Herod the Great delighted much in horses.
Also that one value of the circus was as a place of execution
for tribes who had rebelled against him. His horsemen
on the frontier scouted far and wide for captives and
his cages here were ever full."</p>

<p>"I care not for circuses," said Wulf the Skater. "I
have seen enough of them."</p>

<p>"And I," replied Tostig; "if I might kill an elephant,
it would please me. I have a curiosity to know how long
it taketh so huge a beast to die."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt see elephants enough," said the servitor,
"but they do not often spend them upon the games. They
are costly, and they come from far. Men and women are
plentiful, and they make as good sport in the killing."</p>

<p>The buildings prepared as quarters for trained gladiators,
not slaves, were rude but spacious, and here did
Ulric leave his friends while he returned to the city, but
he remembered the saying of Caius concerning his armor.</p>

<p>"I may wear a tunic and robe only at most times," he
said to himself. "But under the tunic may be a coat of
fine mail and hidden by the robe may be a seax. I will
not be defenseless altogether where there are so many
secret daggers as I hear of. I would have speech with
Lysias, if I may. I trust him not entirely, and I forget
not that he is now of the household of the procurator."</p>

<p>Not justly altogether was he thinking of the young
Greek, for Lysias was a man walking among perils and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
having a wounded heart under his bright mail and his
gay apparel. It was but the next day when he made his
first entrance at the school of Gamaliel. Celebrated over
the inhabited earth was this academy, and many came
from distant lands to hear the teachings of the great and
learned rabbi. Among them, also, were those whose real
purpose was to obtain for themselves the reputation of
scholarship through the name of Gamaliel their teacher,
and they were even as Lysias in that matter. In such a
company, however, small attention was paid to one more
young Greek, who seemed to be rich, save that none questioned
him unwisely after being informed that his protector
was Pontius the Spearman. Moreover, if there
were those who bowed and made way for him on that
account, there were others who bent their brows and drew
aside their garments that he should not touch them.</p>

<p>"Thou art imprudent," said an elderly man to one of
these. "Restrain thy zeal, I pray thee."</p>

<p>"He is a dog!" growled the zealot. "His heathen
master slew my father causelessly in the temple, mingling
his blood with his sacrifice to Jehovah. I am of Galilee."</p>

<p>"I will ask thee, then," said his adviser, "sawest thou
ever this Galilean prophet who cometh from Nazareth?
It is said that he worketh many wonders."</p>

<p>"I have seen him," said the zealot, "and wonders he
doth work. Hath any other rabbi raised the dead? Who
else cleanseth a leper or openeth the eyes of the blind?"</p>

<p>"If thou liest not," was the surly response, "he is indeed
one of the learned. I will hear his teachings when
he cometh to Jerusalem to the Passover feast. But he
will work no wonders here."</p>

<p>"Knowest thou that?" sneered the zealot. "But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
thou knowest from the law, that it is not well for thee to
speak evil of a rabbi. He who revileth one of the learned
goeth to Gehenna."</p>

<p>"I reviled him not!" exclaimed the adviser, as if in
sudden fear. "I am a Pharisee of the Pharisees. I am a
keeper of the whole law. Verily I will hear thy rabbi
when he speaketh. But beware thou of offending the
procurator!"</p>

<p>"Messiah cometh!" said the Galilean fiercely. "He
bringeth a sword! He will make his garments red in the
blood of the heathen!"</p>

<p>"Let not the priests hear thee!" sharply responded the
Pharisee. "To them only is given the discerning of such
matters. Thou wilt yet be cast out of the synagogue."</p>

<p>The angry Galilean walked slowly away. "What know
the Pharisees and the priests concerning Jesus of Nazareth?"
he muttered. "I think of him that he is a more
learned rabbi than any here in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Now Lysias heard these men, and already had he
learned from the Saxons in what manner their jarl had
been healed of his hurts in Galilee.</p>

<p>"This prophet!" he thought. "I will see him if I may.
Alas for me, there is no temple here to Mercurius or to
Apollo! I have great need to offer sacrifices. No! not
to Juno nor to Venus! They have not dealt well with me.
I think I shall now hate Sapphira when I see her. How
is it then that I also love her, seeing that I would slay
her if I could? This is that strange thing between a fool
and a woman."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>In the Court of the Women.</small></span></h2>


<p>It was still the winter time in the Northland, but in
Judea the spring had returned. In the lowlands there
was already much heat and a swift growth of all fruits
of the earth, but in a high place, like Jerusalem upon her
hills, the days were cooler and oft the nights were frosty,
so that men builded fires in their braziers.</p>

<p>"This is not according to nature," said Lars, the son of
Beolf, among his companions. "We have had no snow
save a few flakes, and there hath been no ice thicker than
the blade of my seax. I weary of this land!"</p>

<p>"Hael to the Northland!" exclaimed Tostig the Red.
"Hael to the driving storms and the glittering ice, and to
the frost and to the snow!"</p>

<p>"I will not stay here," said Knud the Bear. "I will
depart from an accursed country wherein there is never
good winter. But didst thou hear the keeper? He saith
that ships at Joppa dare not put to sea because of the
rough weather. What seamen are these!"</p>

<p>"O men!" said Wulf the Skater. "By Odin! If
vikings were at the oars and if I were at the helm, a keel
would seek the open sea."</p>

<p>"We will even go to Joppa when we may," said Tostig.
"But our errand will be to the Northland, that we may
bring back fleets, and in them Saxons, to march with the
jarl into the great battle in Esdraelon. We are too few."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am with thee," said another tall viking. "I have
considered this matter, and I think it is also the mind of
the jarl. He may not go with us, but his secret will is that
we go speedily without him. Then will he truthfully say
to the Romans that he did not command us to go. I will
no longer be shut up in this place as if I were one of the
beasts in yonder dens waiting for my turn to be made a
bloody show of. I am a free warrior, not a caged wild
creature. I will go to the sea."</p>

<p>Other voices were raised in strong accord with his, and
their talk went on until their minds were on fire and their
purposes had become firmly fixed, for they were men of
experience and of great courage. The jarl came not
among them at this time, for he was even then at the
temple gate inquiring as to the right method of obtaining
cattle for his sacrifices to Jehovah. A servitor went into
one of the inner courts and brought out a dealer who had
bullocks at hand, and this man began to name prices,
counting them in shekels of the temple.</p>

<p>"What know I of shekels?" exclaimed Ulric.</p>

<p>"Thou dost not need to know," broke in a voice behind
him. "O jarl, I am here. He asketh thee too much. Let
me attend to this matter. Well for thee that thou hast
it in thy mind to offer sacrifices to the living Jehovah!"</p>

<p>"O my friend!" exclaimed the jarl. "Glad am I of
thy coming! This charge is thine."</p>

<p>"Who art thou that meddlest with another man's
affair?" demanded the dealer angrily.</p>

<p>"Silence, thou!" was the peremptory reply. "I am Ben
Ezra, the interpreter of Caius of Thessalonica, and this is
the captain of his guard and of his Saxons. Beware that
thou deal not fraudulently with any of his people lest I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
have a hand laid upon thee. I am in my right in this
matter."</p>

<p>"That do I now admit," replied the dealer in a changed
manner, "but I charge him not too much. Come thou
and see the cattle."</p>

<p>But the prices he shortly named were less than the half
of his former asking.</p>

<p>"Pay him, O jarl," said Ben Ezra. "It is well. Offer
thy burnt offering, for thou hast great need of the favor
of Jehovah in that which cometh upon thee. I will
remain with thee, for I also offer sacrifices. O dealer, I
will buy of thee. Let the beasts be without blemish. I
will have, also, a lamb and two doves and wine for the
oblation. Pause not, for I have conferred with the high
priest and he knoweth my matter, and this is of his
direction."</p>

<p>But for the guiding of Ben Ezra the jarl had been dealt
with as an ignorant man, a foreigner having money, but
now all things were accomplished with order and rectitude.
Nevertheless, the jarl was displeased that he was
compelled to remain without in the court of the heathen,
not going near the altar whereon his offerings were burnt.</p>

<p>"They would prevent such as I am," he said, "from
drawing too near their God and getting acquainted with
him. I would both see his face and hear his voice. Evil,
evil, is this manner of the Jews! Are they of higher
degree in the sight of their God than am I, the son of
Odin?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, from the place assigned him he might
see all, and there he stood watching the manner of the
slaying of his bullocks and the going up of the great
smoke and the swinging of the censers. He listened, also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
reverently to the chanting of the priests and the Levites
and the responses of the Jewish congregations in the
other courts.</p>

<p>"Ben Ezra," he remarked, "might enter the inner court,
going where he would, for he is a Jew of high degree.
He told me, also, that over yonder is the court of the
women. I have offered my sacrifice. Why do I linger
here?" For his face grew suddenly pale as if he had
been stricken through with a spear, and he exclaimed
again, "The court of the women."</p>

<p>Loudly swelled the sonorous chorus of the many chanting
voices and there came back strange echoes from the
inner walls of the temple. The majesty and the splendor
of the temple service were unspeakable, but the jarl
turned away from it and strode swiftly out of the court
of the heathen. He walked on until he might stand in a
place near the broad passage by which the women worshipers,
veiled or unveiled, were continually coming and
going.</p>

<p>"O Miriam!" he thought. "My eyes have sought thee
as I have walked the streets of this city. Hilda cometh
not any more to counsel me. I am dark in all my mind.
If thou art not here what do I any longer in Jerusalem?
It is not Asgard, and here are no gods at all. It is but a
city of men like myself, and the women are as other
women, and the Romans have the rule in spite of this
Jehovah."</p>

<p>His thoughts were burning within him and he felt the
sickness of disappointment and failure, and his eyes were
dull with longing as he gazed upon this procession of
Hebrew women. Suddenly his heart gave a great leap,
but he stood still, for he heard a voice saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miriam! Thy veil! Cover thyself! Yonder Roman
stareth at thee!"</p>

<p>"I will cleave him to the jaws!" exclaimed Ulric, turning
quickly.</p>

<p>But before he could move a pace or discern one man
from another whom to strike a hand was upon his arm
and he heard a whisper which thrilled him from head to
foot.</p>

<p>"I am Miriam! I am now veiled! Harm not thyself
nor me. I think he heard thee not. Strike not a Roman
lest thou be crucified. Follow me, O beautiful one. Follow
not too nearly, but mark well the house into which
I go. The woman with me is my aunt. The Roman of
whom she warned me is but a dealer in slaves&mdash;but he is
a Roman. Come!"</p>

<p>"I follow thee, O my beloved," whispered the jarl,
"but if he toucheth thee, he shall die if he were Cæsar!"</p>

<p>Sunken-eyed, hollow-cheeked, with a forehead low and
sloping, was the dealer in human cattle who stood shortly
at the street side without the portal. His lips were moving
with an evil expression upon them, and his eyes had
seen too well the exceeding beauty of the Jewish maiden.</p>

<p>"A thousand sesterces for her at Rome," he muttered.
"How shall I obtain her? Pontius hath bidden us beware
of angering the Jews."</p>

<p>Then he came forward a pace and spoke aloud, with
small ceremony, to Ulric.</p>

<p>"She spoke unto thee, O gladiator. Who is she, and
what doest thou here?"</p>

<p>Even for the sake of Miriam was the jarl somewhat
calm in his manner and cunning in his speech, but his
voice was unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Roman," he said, "art thou unwise? Seest thou
not that I am a sword? One greater than thou art will
answer for my going and coming. I but do his bidding.
When thy head passeth suddenly from thy shoulders thou
wilt ask no more questions concerning a damsel who is
guarded by the strong and high one. I will watch for
thee henceforth. I am one who needeth not to be commanded
a second time concerning a sword cut."</p>

<p>"Aha!" snarled the dealer. "I have seen thee heretofore.
Thou art captain of the gladiators of Caius of
Thessalonica. I quarrel not with him."</p>

<p>"Nor dost thou need any quarrel with the procurator,"
said Ulric. "His arm is longer than thine. Keep back
thy foot from unknown ground lest thou shalt meet a man
coming unto thee in sudden haste."</p>

<p>No word came back, but the man's face darkened
venomously, for a Roman liketh not a rebuke from a
barbarian; but there was fire in the eyes of the jarl and
his right hand went under his mantle, and the dealer
understood well the meaning of the movement. Nevertheless,
a mere trafficker in the flesh of men and women
may not wisely stir the wrath of a centurion or of a man
in authority. A Roman may not be scourged or crucified,
but he may die suddenly as well as another. So turned
he sullenly away about his affairs, and the jarl went on
his way.</p>

<p>The streets of Jerusalem are narrow with the exception
of the broad thoroughfares which lead to the outer gates
and the main approaches to the temple. It was a narrow
passage between high palace buildings into which Miriam
and her aunt hastily turned their feet not long after,
escaping from observation by the cruel eyes of the dealer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
in slaves. No word did they utter, and those whom they
met spoke not unto them, for there are laws of privacy
and due reserve among the Jews relating to the public
greeting of women. He who annoyeth them transgresseth
and is liable to be called to an accounting. They
walked onward rapidly, and now the way led along the
side of a mount beyond which was the valley which
divideth the city into, as it were, two cities. Ever at a
little distance behind them strode a tall shape which did
not manifestly appear to pursue them, but for which all
other wayfarers made room on approaching.</p>

<p>"The gladiator seemeth to be in wrath," said one who
looked upon him. "Beware of the anger of these wild
heathen, for they are even as tigers, and they know no
law."</p>

<p>Light was now in his eyes, nevertheless, and his stepping
was that of a stag upon the hills.</p>

<p>"I have found her!" he muttered, joyously. "I have
fulfilled the token that was given me by Hilda in my
dream upon <i>The Sword</i>. Now shall I not soon see Hilda
herself? Hath she not guided me in this, and is she not
now with the gods? This may indeed be the city from
which I shall pass on into Asgard. I am glad that I
offered sacrifices in the temple this day, for at once have
I received this answer from Jehovah that he hath shown
favor unto me. He is indeed the chief God of this land
to this day, for he hath not permitted the Romans to
destroy his temple nor to slay his priests. I think that if
they were to do so, he would be angry and he would
surely take his revenge upon them. That would I do
if I were a god."</p>

<p>The door of a large house swung open as of itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
before Miriam and her companion, but Miriam paused
upon the threshold. Turning and glancing quickly up
and down the street, and seeing no peril, she raised a
hand and beckoned. Ulric came quickly, but Miriam's
aunt was already within.</p>

<p>"Think not to enter with me now," said the Jewish
maiden, hastily. "But tell me quickly, what art thou in
Jerusalem? Why art thou here? What doest thou in
Jehovah's temple?"</p>

<p>"O Miriam, the beautiful!" he responded, gazing upon
her joyously, "I am even as I said to thee in Esdraelon.
I am Ulric, the jarl of the Saxons. I am of Odin's line.
Of the sons of the gods. I offered sacrifices in the temple
of Jehovah asking for thee, and thou seest that he granted
my petition."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke she stepped back within the doorway,
and he also entered with her, but as yet the door closed
not behind them.</p>

<p>"I understand thee partly," she said, trembling greatly.
"Thou art a prince among thine own people. O that thou
wert a son of Abraham! O that thou wert not a slayer
of men in the circus!"</p>

<p>"That I am not!" exclaimed Ulric. "Such business is
not for me. I am a free warrior. I go not again into the
circus. I am with Caius of Thessalonica for a season, for
I am his friend and his guard. I came out from the
Northland into the world that I might seek for the city
of the gods, that there I may meet my kindred. But I
will ask of thee, O beautiful one! O Miriam! how knowest
thou Hilda of the hundred years?"</p>

<p>Her eyes burned earnestly upon him while he was
speaking and her face was as the dawn of a new day, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
in it there were many changes, the color coming and
departing and the lips quivering.</p>

<p>"I know her not," she said; and now they had drifted
on into a small anteroom near the door, her veil, also,
having been put aside more perfectly. "Who is this
Hilda, that thou askest of me such a question?"</p>

<p>"Surely thou knowest her?" he said. "She is a saga
woman of the Northland. She is learned in all the old
runes that are written on the rocks and on the tombs,
and she talketh with the gods in their places. I know
that it is now many months since she hath been laid in
her own tomb in the cleft of the rocks, but I saw her with
thee, speaking to me in a dream, when I was on the sea
in my ship. She bade me sail on and find thee, and this
I have done. Therefore I am glad that I offered sacrifices
to thy God. Henceforth he shall be to me as Odin, the
God who is over all the other gods."</p>

<p>She listened as if his voice were music and as if she
willed that he might not cease speaking.</p>

<p>"Thou hast said!" she now exclaimed, and a voice
behind her, deep and sonorous, added:</p>

<p>"Amen! A great King is he, above all gods. He is the
God of gods, and beside him there is no other; for Jehovah,
our God, is one God, and there is none like him.
O heathen man, thou hast well spoken. This day hast
thou become his servant, for he hath sent unto thee his
commandment in a dream, and thou hast obeyed him.
Also thou hast done well in offering thy burnt sacrifices."</p>

<p>"That did I according to the directions given me by
Ben Ezra from the priests," said the jarl. "But who art
thou?"</p>

<p>"I am Isaac, the aged, the kinsman of this maiden,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
was the response. "O heathen man, I am glad that thou
hast powerful friends, for at this hour we are among
perils, both she and I&mdash;and all our house. I will tell thee,
for one Abbas&mdash;accursed be he of Jehovah!&mdash;threateneth
us with destruction."</p>

<p>"Do I not know him!" exclaimed Ulric. "But surely
he is nidering! He is a weak man, and a traitor and a
thief. If this be so, his blood be upon his own head, for
he must die. I have a matter concerning him that he
knoweth not. O Miriam, I am a leader of men, and I am
not imprudent. Evil is he who is careless concerning
such as thou art. Tell thou me, that I may have strength
to obey thee, do I now remain here longer, or do I
depart?"</p>

<p>As a man wrestling with himself was the jarl, and her
face grew wonderfully kind and sweet as she looked
upon him; but Isaac now stood by her gazing at the jarl,
and the wrinkled features of the old man were full of fear
and trouble.</p>

<p>"Depart!" she said, softly. "It is enough that I have
seen thee again. Fail not to return, but when thou
comest to the door ask only for Isaac. O that thou wert
of my own people!"</p>

<p>"I care not for that matter!" exclaimed Ulric. "It will
not be long before I come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his eyes were looking down, for upon his own
broad, powerful hand came, gently alighting as a bird,
a whiteness which was lighted wonderfully by the red
glow of the ruby in the ring. But the hand of Miriam
lingered not, flitting coyly away as if the bird were
frightened, and in the fingers of the jarl, the son of Odin,
there was a strong tremor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ulric," she said, pronouncing his name for the first
time, with a great sigh, "God hath sent us this promise
of deliverance from our destroyers. Thy Hilda was in
the Northland?"</p>

<p>"An hundred years old was she," said the jarl, "when
I bade her farewell. I loved her more than aught else
upon earth. She was a princess, and her hair was as the
snow, and her smile was exceedingly dear to me. Didst
thou ever know and love such a one?"</p>

<p>"I think she is as Hannah, the prophetess of my people!"
exclaimed Miriam. "But she, too, hath departed.
She was a mother in Israel!"</p>

<p>"Haste!" interrupted Isaac. "Let the young heathen
go his way! This is unseemly for a maiden of Judah!
He may not remain. But, O youth, if thou canst do anything,
withhold not thy hand."</p>

<p>"Fear not!" said the jarl. "I will quickly attend to
Abbas and to whoever worketh with him!"</p>

<p>But his eyes were gazing deeply into the eyes of
Miriam, and it seemed as if in this manner they were
speaking to one another.</p>

<p>"Go!" she whispered. "Have I not thy ruby? Keep
thou, also, my token. I am thine!"</p>

<p>"O Miriam," whispered back Ulric, "I think thee also
a daughter of the gods. I go!"</p>

<p>The door closed behind him and he strode away, but
immediately Isaac spoke chidingly.</p>

<p>"Thou art mad!" he exclaimed, "O foolish daughter of
Israel! O unwise damsel! What is this stranger unto
thee?"</p>

<p>"O Isaac, my kinsman," she replied, "this matter concerneth
both thy life and mine. Did he not fulfill the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
of sacrifices? I will go to my chamber, but I enjoin upon
thee that thou greet him kindly when he returneth."</p>

<p>"That much I will do," said the old man as one who
prudently considereth a difficult affair. "Am not I a man
of understanding? If Jehovah hath sent us a sword for
our protection, blessed be his name! Even this day hath
Abbas been with me, and he hath afflicted me sorely."</p>

<p>"What said he?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"More than I may wisely tell thee," said Isaac. "Only
that he again hath demanded thee as the bride of this
Tyrsus of Chronea. If thou shalt refuse, he will surely
bring thee and thy household before a judge with whom
is a gift and in whose hand is destruction."</p>

<p>"Tell thou that to Ulric the Jarl!" she said, vehemently.
"Where is now thy wisdom? What more, then, hast thou
to say? Is not this the spoiling of thy goods? If I were
given to Tyrsus wouldst thou escape the greed of
Abbas?"</p>

<p>"Father Abraham!" groaned the old man. "We are in
the power of the heathen. Do as thou wilt and I will
speak well to thy swordsman."</p>

<p>Far down the street, not knowing or caring whither
he went, was Ulric the Jarl, but one who stood at the
wayside watched his coming and put out a hand.</p>

<p>"Halt, O jarl! Go no further. Such as thou art have
need of caution. At yonder turn into the valley there are
Roman guards and they will arrest thee as a gladiator
escaped from the circus. Enter not a difficulty."</p>

<p>"O Ben Ezra," exclaimed Ulric, "what sayest thou?
Am not I a free warrior?"</p>

<p>"Not long wilt thou be free at all," said the Jew, "if
thou wanderest imprudently. The edicts have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
strengthened. The master of the games is a hard man
and subtle. Go thou rather to the house of Caius or out
into the valley of Jehoshaphat."</p>

<p>"Thou art my friend," said Ulric, "and I will ask thee
of an important matter. Knowest thou of the doings of
Abbas?"</p>

<p>"He is in the city," said Ben Ezra. "What is thy need
of him? He is evil."</p>

<p>"I require of him nothing but his blood upon a blade,"
said Ulric. "He is a plotter against both Caius and the
procurator."</p>

<p>"Come thou with me to thy friend's house," replied
Ben Ezra. "I know this to be true, but Abbas may not be
slain openly."</p>

<p>"If Pontius will command me," said Ulric, "I will
bring him this serpent's head on the morrow. Otherwise
I will guide my own doing. It is but a stroke of a sharp
sword."</p>

<p>Little said they after that until they were in the house
of Caius, but when they were there it was Ben Ezra and
not the jarl who was summoned to confer with the centurion.
Not long was he absent, but when he returned
his face was dark.</p>

<p>"Trust not a Roman," he whispered to Ulric. "To
them all other men are but as cattle. Thou art only a
swordsman in the eyes of this Caius. Slay not Abbas
lest thou anger him. He is thy friend truly, but it is a
Roman friendship, with a dagger in it. Go thou to thy
men. Would thou wert on the sea! Thou hast no right
to sell them to the circus."</p>

<p>"That will I not!" said Ulric. "But I will confer with
them speedily."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>So went he away, but he went with Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>There are many cunnings among those who struggle in
the net of power, and a great subtlety had been born in
the mind of Lysias. "If the Saxons remain," he had
thought, "I am lost. It is long before they may be slain
in the arena. I will go and talk with them again. This
galley that, is to bear the messenger of Herod lieth at
Joppa."</p>

<p>Therefore, even while Ulric had offered his sacrifices,
the young Greek was among the Saxons telling them
many things.</p>

<p>"This is no merchant craft," he had told them. "This
galley of Herod is small, but strong for a rough sea. Ye
are crew enough."</p>

<p>"That are we," said Tostig the Red. "But the jarl
might forbid our going."</p>

<p>"If ye go not," said Lysias, "ye will be penned as
dangerous beasts. The jarl only is secure among the
great, his friends. He cannot protect you from the
master of the games."</p>

<p>"That dog was here to look at us to-day," said Knud
the Bear. "I like him not. I will wear no fetters of his
clamping. O ye sons of the free vikings, I go to the sea.
Who will go with me to take this keel of Herod?"</p>

<p>"No man will remain behind," said Wulf. "The night
shadows come. There are horses in the stables. Every
man to his armor, and let us take our treasure with us.
We will slay as we go and leave behind us a good mark."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they were prudent, as became warriors
who were few in number, and the guards of the circus
had as yet no command concerning them save to let them
come and go as they would for a season. The stables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
were near and the horses were many, and with these were
only slaves who feared to speak to a swordsman. Therefore,
if a Saxon came to look at beasts or to examine
saddles and bridles, no man hindered him. It was but
thought that he had curiosity as to trappings which he
might use in the games. He did well to take thought
concerning his own business against the hour when he
must slay or be slain. But all the while a fire burned
more hotly in the hearts of the men, for the words of
Lysias were in full accord with many sayings of the jarl.</p>

<p>"He hath been troubled in mind concerning us," they
said. "He knoweth not what to do. We will take away
from him this burden, for we are men and we may save
ourselves. It is not meet that we should encumber our
jarl unduly. He hath done well with us. He would not
have us linger to be slain."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the dusky hour was at hand and Ulric
came not to them, as he at first thought. From the house
of Caius he had been silently led to the house of Ben Ezra,
his friend guiding him as a man who is in deep thought.
The way seemed one which led toward the valley of
Jehoshaphat, through many streets, but they came to a
door before which Ben Ezra paused and turned to the
jarl.</p>

<p>"I will trust thee," he said, "for it is needful. This
is the house of my abiding."</p>

<p>"Not large," said Ulric, "and the front of it is dark and
ancient. I will go in with thee."</p>

<p>"In it dwelleth no other beside myself," said Ben Ezra,
opening the door with a key. "But he who knoweth of
this place knoweth of death. It is a hidden thing in
Israel, and I charge thee by thy gods and by the wrath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
Jehovah, my God, that thou make thyself as one of us
to keep well a thing that is shown unto thee in secret."</p>

<p>"I am a keeper of faith," said Ulric. "I will call it a
secret of the gods, as if it were the tomb of my father.
But in this chamber which we have entered I see nothing
save plain and simple matters."</p>

<p>"Come further," said Ben Ezra, "for thou hast taken
upon thee thy oath. Did I not tell thee that I had been to
the cave in Carmel and that I had made thy treasure
secure?"</p>

<p>"It was buried well," said Ulric. "I think no stranger
could have found it."</p>

<p>"Neither would it have been of any use to thee or me,"
said Ben Ezra. "Couldst thou strike with thy seax if it
were buried in a cave in Carmel? It is better at thy
hand."</p>

<p>"I understand thee," exclaimed Ulric. "At this hour,
here in Jerusalem, I have need of money. I was never so
at any time. It is true that gold coins may be good
weapons. I will be glad of them and of the jewels."</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Ben Ezra, "already have I paid much
to Pontius the Spearman and to the high priest and to the
captain of the temple. Greedy were they, but I have
satisfied them. Of thy share in the matter they know not.
Thou hast no need to go to thy men this night, for the
morning will do as well, and thou canst plan how they
may escape to their own land."</p>

<p>"So will I do," said Ulric. "I will abide with thee.
But this seemeth to be as other houses."</p>

<p>"So hath it seemed to any who dwelt here," said Ben
Ezra, "unless they were as I am. Is not this back wall
strongly made of well-fitted masonwork?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>"A well-made wall," said Ulric. "None may break
it through. The stones are very large."</p>

<p>Far back from the street were they now, and the house
which had appeared small was seen to be of great extent,
as if builded down a steep slope. Suddenly the jarl exclaimed:</p>

<p>"A door of a stone! O Jew, how is it that this great
marble turneth at thy pushing?"</p>

<p>"See thou," said Ben Ezra. "It is set into the wall
upon pivotings. Therefore it is as firm as the rest of the
wall unless it shall be tried by one who knoweth the catch-pin
at the side. Even then a weak hand moveth it not.
I will show thee, and then do thou make trial for thyself."</p>

<p>The jarl watched and understood.</p>

<p>"A marvelous trick!" he exclaimed, opening and shutting
the secret door and finding that much strength was
required. "O Jew, beyond is a corridor of stone, and I
see steps which go downward."</p>

<p>"Before thee is a great deep," replied Ben Ezra. "Thou
art trusted as to this thing in the name of Jehovah. Go
in, O jarl of the Saxons. Thou wilt go down into the
secret chambers of Jerusalem with me."</p>

<h2><a name="XXXVI" id="XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Secret Messenger.</small></span></h2>


<p>Lysias, the Greek, stood reverently before the Roman
ruler of Jerusalem, and the dark, piercing eyes of Pontius
were watching his face intently.</p>

<p>"O most noble Pontius," said Lysias, "I have done as
thou didst order. All these were the words of Ben Ezra,
nor have I failed to tell thee every saying of Abbas and
of him who was with him. The messenger from
Machærus goeth swiftly to Joppa and the galley of Herod
waiteth for him."</p>

<p>They were standing in the small chamber near the
banquet hall, and the voice of Lysias was hushed and
tremulous, for the brows of the procurator were knitting
and the veins in his temples were swelling.</p>

<p>"Well for thee, O Greek," he muttered, hoarsely.
"But now it is as if Herod himself were to be with Cæsar,
bringing gifts. The very gods are against me!"</p>

<p>"O most noble Pontius," said Lysias, raising his head
courageously, "bid me depart and it may be that neither
galley nor messenger shall cross the sea to Rome."</p>

<p>"I may not hinder a royal messenger," said Pontius,
gloomily. "To do so were sure destruction. Thou canst
do nothing."</p>

<p>"But if," whispered Lysias&mdash;"if Herod, the tetrarch,
might know that his galley had departed, and if afterward
no man came to tell him of her voyage?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>"A man may hear good tidings," said the procurator,
with a dark smile dawning in his face. "But be not thou
at any time the bringer of news concerning this galley.
Thou hast a letter to bear for me to Cornelius at Cæsarea.
I bid thee to go by way of Joppa and to return. I now
write the parchment. Ride thou thy own swift beast.
Whoever may be traveling upon their own errands at this
time, I meddle not with their affairs."</p>

<p>"Thanks, noble Pontius," said Lysias, "but I will give
thee a token. A man will come to thee in haste shortly
from the keeper of the circus. He will know nothing of
the galley of Herod, but he will tell thee of her departure
from Joppa and of her crew. So shalt thou be sure that
I know not aught except my errand to Cornelius."</p>

<p>Hasty was now the going and the returning of the
procurator, but Lysias had now a small tablet and not a
parchment to put into his pouch, neither looked he upon
the writing on the tablet.</p>

<p>"Go!" said Pontius. "I will wait for thy man from the
circus. Tell me no more!"</p>

<p>Then passed Lysias out into the corridor and the eyes
of Pontius followed him.</p>

<p>"Subtle are the Greeks," he muttered. "Already yonder
youth knoweth enough to kindle a fire that would
burn to Tartarus. Let him do this one thing and I will
give him a gift which he hath never yet received."</p>

<p>Not far had Lysias gone along the corridor when a
hand withheld him and there was a whisper.</p>

<p>"Lysias! Love! Whither goest thou?"</p>

<p>"Sapphira! O beautiful one! I may not linger. I
ride swiftly to Cæsarea. I will return to thee. Wait thou
for me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Lysias! Favored of Aphrodite! Go and return to
me. I shall then have many things to tell thee. Then
shalt thou know I have loved thee."</p>

<p>Her arms were around him, her kiss was upon his lips,
and she was gone. He, too, went on in haste, leaving the
palace, but she had retreated into an inner chamber,
luxuriously furnished, wherein a lamp was burning.</p>

<p>"I will wait here for my mistress," she said. "A
strange thing is love, for it may be lighted like this lamp.
It may go out and it may burn again if one willeth. I
think I must put out this love of mine for Lysias lest it
should burn me. Alas for him or for any who may be
made the bearer of secret messages! And I? O Lysias!
Well for thee that thou knowest not this change which
is in store for me. And thou, O beautiful Aphrodite, be
not angry with me that I am to become also a Jewish
proselyte and offer sacrifices to the God of the Jews. My
mistress hath bidden me to become free and to wed
Ananias. It is better so than to be a slave, or to throw
myself away upon a Greek youth who must shortly disappear.
I love not ruin. I am to be rich and I shall be
the favorite of more gods than one."</p>

<p>She spoke with a triumph upon her face and with
exultation in her voice. Then she reclined upon a couch,
with the light of the lamp shining brilliantly upon her
goodly raiment and her beauty, and so she awaited the
coming of the wife of the procurator.</p>

<p>Through the Damascus gate passed Lysias, and not
long afterward an ass halted near the amphitheater,
further down the valley. A slave came out to attend to
the ass, and was followed by the master of the games.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" he demanded, surlily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>"See that thou hinder me not," said Lysias. "Look
well upon this signet."</p>

<p>"I obey the procurator," said the master of the games.
"Do thou his bidding. But I will see nothing that thou
hast in thy hand by any commandment from him. Hold
thou thy peace, O messenger. I meddle not."</p>

<p>Lysias had dismounted and, without more words, he
passed on into the quarters of the Saxons. Excepting
themselves, no others were present to observe or to hear,
but he did not find men who were taking rest. Some
were making up packages for carrying, some were examining
carefully their arms and armor as if about to go
into battle, but they greeted the Greek heartily. He
looked around him for a moment, not without an understanding
of this which they were doing.</p>

<p>"I am in season, O Tostig the Red," he said altogether
as if he had been expected to come. "But put ye on
Roman helmets, every man. Ye are to ride fast to Joppa
this night. Right glad am I to be your guide, for the
roads might prove misleading."</p>

<p>"Hael to thee, O Greek!" exclaimed Tostig. "Even
now are the horses nearly prepared. We will mount at
thy bidding. But hast thou at all seen the jarl?"</p>

<p>"By the will of the gods, and not by his own, he may
not now come," said Lysias. "Were he here, he would
say that ye go forth at once and that ye ride well. Mark
this saying, however, that there will be one at the shore
who must by all means enter the galley, but who must
not travel far in her."</p>

<p>"It is but a spear thrust," said Knud the Bear. "We
will attend to his case."</p>

<p>Silently all, but openly and boldly as by men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
obeyed a high command, were the horses led out and
mounted. There were also led horses for the packages
and for changes, and there was no Roman officer of rank
at hand to call this doing in question.</p>

<p>"Ride!" said Tostig. "Odin! It will not be well for
any who shall cross our path!"</p>

<p>None was likely to do so. The Romans held Judea
by garrisons in forts and camps, and not greatly by
moving forces. The highway to Joppa would be deserted
after nightfall. Who should rashly interfere with
mounted spearmen, whose very helmets were as a sharp
warning to the imprudent?</p>

<p>"Swiftly! Swiftly!" exclaimed Lysias, before long.
"We now pass the hill of Golgotha. On that mount have
many been crucified. Make thee sure that ye get well
away with this galley of Herod and that no man may find
you upon it in after time. I tell you truly that if ye are
now taken prisoners ye would but climb yonder Hill of
Skulls."</p>

<p>Silent were the Saxons at that hard saying, but the
horses under them appeared to spring forward as if with
one accord.</p>

<p>It was at the foot of a steep declivity that the galloping
ceased for a brief resting of the horses, and Tostig exclaimed:</p>

<p>"O Knud the Bear, this is well. We have gone far.
But I like not this manner of departing from our jarl.
I think I should have seen his face and heard his commandment.
Were he to need my sword on the morrow,
I would be at his side."</p>

<p>"I also," responded Knud. "We are his own men and
he is ours. It is in his heart that we may return to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
Middle Sea with a hundred keels. What, then, would
we care for Roman triremes? We could slay all the
legionaries in Judea."</p>

<p>"If we might indeed land here again," said Wulf the
Skater, doubtfully. "At all events we have no more upon
our hands this night than to take the keel which is prepared
for us and to put to sea."</p>

<p>So said they all, and again they pushed forward, but
after a while the road by which they traveled was no
longer so rugged and so hilly.</p>

<p>"We shall kill the horses," they said, "but we may
reach the sea before the dawn."</p>

<p>So did it prove, for more than one horse gave out and
his rider mounted another from those which were led
without any heavy burden. It was yet dark, at the last,
when Tostig exclaimed:</p>

<p>"O Greek, I hear the sound of waves upon a beach.
Are we now near Joppa?"</p>

<p>"Too near," replied Lysias, "for into the town itself
we may not safely go. We will turn here by this road
at the right. If we encounter guards or a patrol, let there
be no report made of our passing."</p>

<p>"Halt!" rang out in the road a little ahead of them.
"The password! Who are ye?"</p>

<p>It was a legionary at his post, a sentry on guard, and
to him rode Knud the Bear.</p>

<p>"I am this," he said. "Take thou my token!"</p>

<p>Down fell the soldier, speared through the face, so that
he spoke not again, and on rode the Saxons toward the
sea.</p>

<p>"We have now only starlight," said Lysias, "but yonder
at anchor floateth the galley of Herod, the tetrarch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
This is according to the saying of the procurator. All is
well, for he who cometh hath not arrived. There are
boats; take them. But here do I leave you, for I have a
further errand. Fare thee well."</p>

<p>"Success to thee, O Lysias," said Tostig. "We are thy
friends henceforth. Haste thee about thy business. We
can care for ourselves now that we see keels and waves."</p>

<p>Many voices bade him good speed, and the strong ass
appeared but little wearied as he sprang away northward
along the beach.</p>

<p>"Glad am I not to be in Joppa this day," said Lysias.
"If I am heard from next at the house of Cornelius at
Cæsarea, no man will accuse me of having too much
acquaintance with the doings of the gladiators of Caius.
I did but bring to them an order whereof I knew not the
meaning. I am but a messenger, carrying letters to and
fro."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his heart was full of great anxiety and
he remembered how dark had been the hard face of the
procurator.</p>

<p>The fishing boats were many, but only two large ones
were taken. Into these the Saxons put their baggage of
all kinds, but they drove away their horses to a good distance
down the beach. Then they took the oars and in
a short rowing they were near the galley.</p>

<p>Over the bulwark leaned an armed man as the boats
touched the side.</p>

<p>"Whence come ye?" he demanded, but he spoke as to
friends, for he was at that hour expecting such an arrival
and he saw the Roman helmets.</p>

<p>For a moment no voice replied to him, but the Saxons
went quickly over the bulwark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>"Slay now, but cast none overboard!" commanded
Tostig. "Here are soldiers sleeping."</p>

<p>These who slept were not many of them Romans, but
more were soldiers of Herod, Jews and Arabians and
Edomites. They died speedily under the swift thrusting
of the Saxon spears, but the watchman had fallen first.</p>

<p>"Spare the rowers in their places," said Wulf the
Skater. "We will use them."</p>

<p>But these rowers were all slaves, in chains, and they
looked upon the slaughter in silence, as if it were no affair
of their own.</p>

<p>"Be ready, all!" suddenly commanded Tostig. "Utter
no sound! A boat cometh from the shore, as Lysias gave
us to expect. Not from this beach, but from a pier in the
harbor. In it are but few men. In the prow is some
great one, but he weareth no helmet. Let them come on
board with all safety, but none in that boat may return
to Joppa."</p>

<p>For a cause known to themselves not one of them had
any purpose of at once returning. They came swiftly to
the galley and all climbed eagerly on board, casting adrift
their boat to float where it would.</p>

<p>"Away!" shouted he who seemed their leader, as if
speaking to sailors who were under his own direction.
"Row out of the harbor quickly. Speed, or a scourge for
every back!"</p>

<p>Saxon hands were already raising the anchor and the
rowers put out their oars as they were bidden.</p>

<p>"O all ye gods!" suddenly cried out the great man,
stumbling over a fallen soldier. "What is this? O my
destruction! The hand of Pontius the Spearman is here!
I perish!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>Then fell his head upon the deck at the stroke of Knud
the Bear, and shortly all his companions went down in
like manner, for they were astonished and they did no
fighting.</p>

<p>Being in fear of death, the rowers rowed with great
vigor and Tostig was at the helm.</p>

<p>"She is swift!" he exclaimed. "She is a good keel and
she rideth well the waves. We are upon the sea! Hael
to the Northland!"</p>

<p>Loudly shouted all the vikings, clashing their shields,
for it was a joy to feel the lifting of the long billows and
once more to wipe the salt spray from their faces. They
rapidly examined the ship from stem to stern, but there
was much which required more thorough searching.</p>

<p>"O that the jarl were here with us!" groaned Tostig.
"The day is here. We, his friends, have escaped from the
Romans and from the circus, but our jarl is on the land.
It is evil! How shall I answer concerning him when I
am inquired of at his own house? Will not some men
say that I am nidering?"</p>

<p>Long leagues were rowed and then, for the wind was
now right, the sail was lifted.</p>

<p>"We will cast overboard these who were slain," said
Knud. "We will weight them, that they may sink. So
shall none tell a tale of us to any who may follow. We
do as the jarl would have bidden."</p>

<p>"Thou art prudent," said Tostig. "So much for the
secret messengers of Herod. We have shed blood upon
this ship and the gods of the North are with us. Only
let us with care avoid all triremes, for we do not need to
be inquired of by a stronger force."</p>

<p>"This is now the spring," said Lars, the son of Beolf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
"If we pause not needlessly, we shall soon reach the fiords,
but there will be no ice in them."</p>

<p>"It is a good cruise," said another. "We may take
much plunder by the way. Let us now search again the
cabins of this galley."</p>

<p>Much that astonished them had been found with those
who came on board in the boat that they might be slain.
More was now discovered in secret places.</p>

<p>"Odin!" exclaimed Knud, examining these matters.
"Here are many coins of silver and of gold and a number
of bright stones. I think these may have been gifts from
Herod, the king, to Cæsar at Rome, but he will not soon
see them."</p>

<p>"There are also fine weapons and garments," said
Wulf. "It is a very rich galley."</p>

<p>The sun was unclouded, the wind blew fairly from the
east, the galley sped forward gallantly, and the rowers
rested upon their seats, but now Tostig the Red stood
upon the after deck with all the Saxons around him.</p>

<p>"I have heard ye all," he said, for they had been speaking
many things. "We are of one mind. But if it be
your will that I shall now take upon me the command of
this keel, put ye your hands in mine and give me your
oath to this saying, that we will be satisfied with this
great plunder which we have already taken; that we will
keep the open sea, not landing save for food or water;
that we will care to take no other keel but this; and that
we will sail on until we see the house of Brander the
Brave upon the shore of the Northland. After that we
will come back to the Middle Sea with many swords and
we will seek for Ulric, our jarl, until we find him."</p>

<p>"So will we do!" shouted Knud the Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>One by one did the Saxons then step forward and put
their hands between the hands of Tostig, and the oath
was an oath.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they were as men who had sailed away
forever, unless the gods should see fit to accomplish this
their purpose of coming again with a fleet, and with a
host to follow Ulric the Jarl and his captain into the great
battle in Esdraelon.</p>

<p>Well was it for them that they had thus escaped the
sure perils of the circus if they might also escape the
many perils of the sea. They might indeed avoid the triremes
of Rome, and little cared hardy vikings for rough
weather, but the voyage would be long and they were
not many spearmen. The slave rowers, however, were
sturdy fellows, well selected, and these were likely to be
better contented with masters who flogged them not unduly
and who thought it a shame that even a beast, being
their own, should not be well fed and cared for.</p>

<p>As for Tostig the Red, he had become stern and
moody, smiling not at all, and he told the rest of the
vikings that Ulric, the son of Brander, was still his jarl,
and that as Ulric, to his thinking, would have directed
in any case, so would he order.</p>

<p>"That will be well for us," they said.</p>

<p>"I have been troubled in my mind," he told them. "I
think that I may yet slay many Romans at the side of the
son of Odin. I myself saw that Jewish god of his that
healed him of his hurts. I heard his words and they were
good to hear, although I understood him not very well.
If he is to be the captain of the host, over the jarl, I am
contented. But never yet did I see a better sword than is
our jarl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor did we," they answered him. "We will surely
return with thee to the Middle Sea, and our treasure shall
go with thine to the making of many great keels and the
gathering of the swordsmen of the North."</p>

<p>All things seemed going well with them, but there was,
nevertheless, a shadow upon the ship, and when the sun
was setting Tostig the Red sat upon the after deck sharpening
his seax upon a stone and now and then gazing
backward toward the east.</p>

<p>"Would I were with him this hour," he said in a low,
sad voice. "How shall the years go by with me henceforth
if I am never again to see the face of my jarl?"</p>

<h2><a name="XXXVII" id="XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The House of Ben Ezra.</small></span></h2>


<p>In the house of Ben Ezra, at the head of the flight of
stone steps in the secret passage, Ulric the Jarl stood
looking down into a great darkness. But now Ben Ezra
came to him, having lighted a large brazen lamp which
swung like a cresset at the end of a wooden rod a fathom
long. The flame of the lamp was very brilliant, but the
smoke thereof was unpleasant to the smell because of
some strange oil which burned in it. Such a lamp might
not be lighted at a feast or in the dwellings of men.</p>

<p>"Follow me, O jarl," he said. "This is the underworld
and thou and I are alone in this place. But not all the
swords of Cæsar could find thee if thou wert hidden here.
It hath been a refuge for some who fled from a destroyer."</p>

<p>"O Jew," said Ulric, "I will cover this thy secret. May
I fail of Valhalla, dying as a cow dieth, if I betray thee!"</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ben Ezra, and they went on down the
stairway together.</p>

<p>At the foot of it was a low chamber, the air of which
was heavy, but Ben Ezra turned to the left, and as he
lifted his lamp there might be seen a narrow cleft in the
masonry. A little inside of this cleft there was a barrier
of iron-bound woodwork.</p>

<p>"Lift it away by its hand pieces," said Ben Ezra.
"Thou art stronger than I."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p>Very massive was the wooden barrier, but it might be
dragged forth and laid upon the floor, and at once a
current of cold, damp air poured through the opening,
bringing with it a smell as of earth.</p>

<p>"I will go in first," said Ben Ezra. "Now will I show
thee my crypt."</p>

<p>In a moment more they were stooping over an open
coffer, and he said:</p>

<p>"Here are my treasures and thine, and somewhat which
belongeth to thy men. I would they might have it, for
we need not any goods but our own. Thou shalt take
away at thy will whatever is thine own."</p>

<p>"I may not remove it now," said Ulric, "save a bag of
golden coins. But I would ask of thee, if thou wilt tell
me, what is this place that we are in and how is there
such a cavern, with masonwork and corridors and pillars
and cunning doors? Are we to go on into it?"</p>

<p>"Thou wilt go no further lest thou lose thyself as in a
wilderness," said the Jew, pointing down the passageway.</p>

<p>"It is like a cave," said Ulric. "I never heard of caves
under a city."</p>

<p>"Behold," said Ben Ezra, "the secret of Jerusalem. It
is from the earliest time. There was a fort here in the
days of Adam and here the giants had their dwelling.
There are no writings of those ancient days. But on
these hills and in these valleys city after city hath been
builded and destroyed. For those walls and buildings
much masonry was needed. There were vast halls and
hollows made in quarrying stone during ages. Afterward
these openings were sealed and made of the secrets
of priests and kings. They will not be opened until
Messiah cometh."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is to be thy great king," said Ulric. "What need
hath he of caves?"</p>

<p>"Not any," said Ben Ezra, "but he will know in what
hidden depth he shall find the treasures of Adam and of
the giants and of the old kings and of Solomon, for all
are yonder, where none but he may lay a hand upon
them. Let us go."</p>

<p>"I have seen a wonder," said Ulric following his guide.
"But if this god from Nazareth is to be thy king, wilt
thou not thyself inform him of the way through thy
house into his hidden places?"</p>

<p>"He will have no need," said Ben Ezra; "but if I saw
that he had the right to know, I would tell him. Messiah
knoweth all things. As for this rabbi of Galilee, he
cometh to Jerusalem even now, for the Passover feast
draweth near. I would gladly hear him again. During
years that are gone there have been many sayings concerning
him."</p>

<p>"I know that he hath healed my hurts," said Ulric.
"He hath also done in like manner by many another. I
think that I shall yet be a captain of men under him, and
the great battle cometh."</p>

<p>They were now in the upper room and the stone door
had been closed behind them, swinging upon its pivots.</p>

<p>"Am I to abide here this night?" asked Ulric. "I have
an errand of mine own in the morning. After that is
done I must go to my men. They will surely need
counsel and ordering."</p>

<p>"I will now show thee thy chamber wherein thou art
to sleep," said Ben Ezra. "But, I pray thee, do not too
many errands within the city walls, and neglect not to
visit Caius of Thessalonica lest thou lose thy strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
friend. It is needful for thee to be seen much at his
house."</p>

<p>"I will truly care for him," said Ulric. "It is my duty.
But I have a great concern as to my companions. O that
they were even now upon the sea and utterly escaped
from the circus!"</p>

<p>"Else they will surely all be slain," said Ben Ezra; but
he led the way to a place for sleeping and the night closed
over all.</p>

<p>When the next morning came the watchmen upon the
walls of Joppa took note that the swift galley of Herod,
the tetrarch, had already departed. So sent they in their
due report, but already had it been discovered that whoever
might now be in her had left behind them strange
tokens. In the highway north of the tower came a company
of legionaries to change the sentries, and at the
turning of the road they found but a dead man, slain by
a spear thrust through his head. Who could have done
this deed in a day of peace they guessed not at all, but
their officer spoke of the Jackal of Machærus. Not long
afterward a horseman in bright armor rode along the
beach seeing empty boats that were cast up by the waves,
and also the empty place where the evening before the
galley had been anchored.</p>

<p>"I am too late!" he shouted, angrily. "The traitor
hath escaped to Rome! What answer shall I give to
Herod Antipas? His brother hath again outwitted him
and I think he is in league with the procurator."</p>

<p>Further up the beach men led along many horses,
saddled and bridled, which they had found astray and
ownerless, and this thing also was a riddle.</p>

<p>The governor of Joppa was quickly informed of all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
that he might make his report to his commander; but at
that hour Pontius the Spearman was sitting in the seat
of judgment thinking not of Joppa, and before him came
not only his own officers, but Jews, also, and people from
the towns and the provinces. Suddenly, however, he
turned from aught else to look into the face of one who
came in haste, seeming to be greatly disturbed in mind.
It was the master of the games who now stood opposite
the chair of judgment, and at a sign of the procurator's
hand he spoke rapidly until he had told his errand, speaking
low that none else might hear.</p>

<p>"O thou," said Pontius, calmly, "go back to thy affairs.
I care not greatly what Caius hath done with his gladiators.
If indeed they have rebelled and if they are in
Judea or Samaria, I will retake them for him in season
for the games. The fault is not thine."</p>

<p>"O most noble Pontius," said the master of the games,
"what sayest thou of the Greek? He came unto them, as
I testified."</p>

<p>"What is that to thee?" responded the procurator
haughtily. "Care thou for thy beasts and thy cages. See
that thou speak not at all to him of this matter when thou
seest him. Go thy way!"</p>

<p>The master of the games trembled somewhat as he
went forth and Pontius followed him not with his eyes,
but muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"The Greek hath made good his token of a man from
the circus. I will now wait for a word from Joppa, but I
will not question him imprudently when he returneth
from Cæsarea."</p>

<p>Heavy matters were now coming before him, and
among them all was none which seemed to trouble him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
more than did certain testimonies concerning the evil
deeds of robbers from the wilderness of Judea.</p>

<p>"O ye Jews!" exclaimed the angry magistrate. "How
shall I execute justice when so many of you are in league
with these evil-doers? In this city is the refuge of these
wicked men. Who will capture for me this Bar Abbas
that I may crucify him? He hath kindred among you
and ye shelter him!"</p>

<p>Loud were the indignant protests which replied to him
from scribes and rabbis and rulers, but far back, near the
entrance of the hall of judgment, were twain who listened
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Father Abraham!" hoarsely whispered one of these.
"I may not upon any account bring my matter before
him. Even now is my son at my house and he brought
much profit with him. He is worth more to me than are
all the robbers of Gilboa or the tribes beyond Jordan. He
must not fall into the hands of these Roman heathen lest I
also be destroyed. The God of Israel be my protector
against the enemy!"</p>

<p>Searching eyes were upon him, but the thought in the
mind of Ulric, the son of Brander, was: "Well for me
that I fell in with him as I left the house of Ben Ezra.
Well that I followed him even here. Now will I not
cease until I know his abiding place."</p>

<p>Cowering and hiding his face, did Abbas hasten away,
hardly daring to look behind him. Many were coming
and going, however, and the guilty dealer in stolen goods
might not take warning of the manner in which he was
followed vengefully from street to street.</p>

<p>"I may not smite him now," said the pursuer, "but he
and another will shortly be touched by a sharp edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
There entereth he a door and I will leave him for this
time. Now must I see Caius and then I go to my companions.
Would that they were on their way to the
Northland. Woe to me if I bring harm to them!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even before going to the house of Caius,
the jarl did one thing which relieved both his heart and
his hands from a heavy weight. He went to the door of
a house and he was admitted, but he tarried not there, and
he came out again, going on in haste, but with less gloom
upon his face.</p>

<p>"She will think well of me!" he exclaimed. "I might
not have speech with her, but she will look upon my token
and she will bless me."</p>

<p>In the house from which he had departed, and in an
inner chamber of it, stood the Hebrew maiden, and before
her was Isaac, the aged, her near kinsman. He placed
upon a table a heavy bag and he essayed to speak, but his
lips trembled and his voice failed him.</p>

<p>"O Isaac, what is this?" she exclaimed. "Where didst
thou obtain money, seeing the manner in which we are
hindered? Hast thou indeed betrayed me again by thy
weakness?"</p>

<p>"Nay! Nay! It is thine!" shouted Isaac. "Thy heathen
prince came to the door. I saw him, but he lingered
not and none other had speech with him. 'This is for
her,' he said. 'Tell her I watch and I return, but that she
may not go forth, not even to the temple.' So I brought
the bag to thee, wondering. Count it, for I have not
counted."</p>

<p>He himself untied the bag and poured out the coins
upon the table, counting, while Miriam watched as one
who seeth dimly in a dream of the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ulric, Ulric," she muttered, "thou art more to me
than are these. I think of thee that thou art pure gold,
but who may weigh thee in the balances? Come to me,
for great is my need of thy counsel!"</p>

<p>"Of Rome and of Greece and of Judea are these coins,"
said Isaac. "They are thrice our present requirement.
Jehovah hath turned to thee the heart of this idolater and
thou doest well to make him serve thee. Thou hast the
understanding which is given to women. We will pay
our oppressors. We will give a goodly gift to the judge
and to the chief priests. We will offer a sacrifice of burnt
offering of a sweet savor. And God, even our God, will
yet deliver thee also from the hand of this heathen
gladiator."</p>

<p>"Isaac," she exclaimed, "peace! Speak not of him
unduly! Would that a false judgment concerning money
were our only peril."</p>

<p>"O Miriam," said the old man, putting the coins in
again and tying the bag, "that also hath been provided
for. In this house we may not safely remain, but a sure
refuge hath been offered and we shall be for a season as
if we were hidden in a well. One cometh shortly to be
our guide, and it is needful that thy heathen prince, also,
should have information, for he hath more gold than this
and his hand is now open."</p>

<p>"Peace!" she again exclaimed, but Isaac went out with
the bag, saying:</p>

<p>"Great are the gifts of Jehovah of Hosts! Would that
he might now send the sword of this Philistine who
loveth her upon the necks of our enemies!"</p>

<p>"I will wait," she was whispering, "until I see him."</p>

<p>Long was the remaining of Ulric the Jarl at the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
of Caius of Thessalonica, but afterward he went out at
the Damascus gate purposing to visit the amphitheater.
He went on down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, walking
slowly, and he came to the bridge over the brook Kidron,
by which he was to pass.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said a youth who waited at the bridge, "a
token from Ben Ezra!"</p>

<p>"None heareth," replied Ulric. "Say on."</p>

<p>"Thy men are not at the circus, he bade me tell thee,
and no man knoweth whither they are gone. Go thou
not thither now, but let the house of Caius be thy refuge,
for there will be an inquiry for thee."</p>

<p>Still as a stone stood the jarl while one might breathe
three times.</p>

<p>"I thank thee and him, O youth," he said then. "Go
thou to him with his word only, that neither he nor I
need any to tell us whereunto the sons of the Northland
have departed. I will do as he hath said."</p>

<p>The youth went from him running, but Ulric did not
reenter the city by the Damascus gate.</p>

<p>"It will be safer to choose another," he said. "I was
seen by the guards when I came forth. They may by this
time have some evil commandment concerning me."</p>

<p>So therefore he made a great circuit of the walls, going
far, and even after he selected a gate by which he might
prudently go in he seemed to have another matter upon
his hands. The hours went by, one after another, and it
was long after the sunset before he was known to be in
the house of Caius. Then speedily he was sent for and
he went in to what was now the sick chamber of the
centurion.</p>

<p>"O jarl," said he, "how is it with thee?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>"O most noble Caius," replied the jarl, "I am well, but
I am alone in Jerusalem. All of my companions have returned
to their own land."</p>

<p>"Well for thee," said Caius. "Of that I had been informed.
A swift messenger from the governor of Joppa
brought strange news to the procurator. What sayest
thou if thy men have been hired to serve upon a ship by
Herod, the tetrarch? Would they not guard well?"</p>

<p>"O Caius," said the jarl, "thou knowest them and I
need say no more, for I am ignorant of all this matter
save that they are gone."</p>

<p>"I find no fault with thee," said Caius. "The messenger
was sent to me and I have fully questioned him.
Also word came from the procurator that I trouble thee
not, for Herod must be allowed to direct his own affairs.
If he have hired good swordsmen, surely his galley is in
safe keeping."</p>

<p>Ulric looked at him darkly, for the voice of Caius was
as of one who mocketh bitterly.</p>

<p>"O Caius," said the jarl, "if thou wilt hear me, I have
another affair upon my mind. I like not the appearance
of thy sore."</p>

<p>"Jarl of the Saxons," exclaimed the centurion, "I seem
to myself to be rotting away. I am as one who hath the
leprosy. But what knowest thou of any healing?"</p>

<p>"Only this that I have heard this day," said Ulric. "I
would have thee live until the arrival of this Jesus of
Nazareth. He cometh now to the feast of the Jews. He
is of the sons of the gods. Did he not heal me? And
may he not also do something for thee?"</p>

<p>"O that he might come quickly!" said Caius. "But
the gods can do little for such a torment as mine. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
are many things which are too much for them. But I
will see him when he cometh. I would make him rich
with gifts if he would heal me."</p>

<p>"I will watch for him," said the jarl. "I may not go
again to the circus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go not!" exclaimed Caius. "Remain much with me.
O Saxon, when this fire burneth within me I would
gladly fall upon my sword but that it would please my
enemies. But if thou goest out now, return quickly. Of
this be thou sure in thy mind, that I will not permit thee
to enter the circus. Thy sword will have better business.
I will speak of thee again to the procurator. A messenger
from him hath arrived. Leave me with him."</p>

<p>More words might not be spoken and the jarl went out,
but it could be understood that with difficulty did the
centurion restrain himself and conceal from all the extremity
of his suffering from that deadly thing.</p>

<p>"I will go to the house of Ben Ezra," thought Ulric.
"Already have I made sure that there are fewer enemies
to bring peril upon Miriam and her people. I will see if
the Jew hath well attended to his portion of her business.
But unless help cometh to him speedily, Caius will surely
die."</p>

<h2><a name="XXXVIII" id="XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a><br />

<span class="smcap"><small>The Son of Abbas.</small></span></h2>


<p>Long and thoughtfully and with many questionings
did Ben Ezra listen to the jarl in an inner chamber of his
house. "Thou hast done well," he said, at last, "but trust
thou not too much the favor of the great. Neither be
thou too sure concerning their power. The leaves fall
from all the trees in due season. Full of jealousy and of
suspicion and of murder are all they who prosper under
Cæsar. In the day and in the night is there a weapon not
far from any of them. So deal they with others. A
Roman friend is ever also a Roman enemy holding a
knife, and by the hands of their friends do men die continually
at Rome."</p>

<p>"That do I believe," said Ulric. "I will be exceedingly
prudent. But, O my friend, what hast thou done concerning
Miriam?"</p>

<p>"I have done all thus far," said Ben Ezra. "I did but
need to buy the good-will of the judge and one peril
passed away. To him and to another I could both pay
more and promise more than was in the will of Abbas.
But thou, O jarl, hast thou seen the face of this Roman
dealer in slaves?"</p>

<p>"That peril also hath departed," said Ulric. "I am told
that a man in haste met him in the valley of Hinnom.
The patrol found him there in their passing, and his head
lay at six cubits' length from his body."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p>"He had many enemies," said Ben Ezra, thoughtfully.
"One may even have followed him from the city. I have
now another word for thee concerning Abbas, now that
thou hast heard the procurator upon the judgment seat
give authority to all such as thou art concerning the taking
of his son. The robbers are a power in Jerusalem and
the sword of Bar Abbas is against thee."</p>

<p>"I have never seen him," said Ulric.</p>

<p>"Then will I tell thee of his face," said Ben Ezra, and
he minutely did so, line by line.</p>

<p>"Fear not," said Ulric. "I would now know that man
if but half his face were shown."</p>

<p>"He is said to be cunning in disguises," replied Ben
Ezra, "but his best keeper is the fear of men that by denouncing
him they may bring upon themselves secret
daggers and a vengeance which faileth not."</p>

<p>"No fear have I," muttered Ulric, "but how am I to
find him!"</p>

<p>"I trust that thou wilt be prospered in that matter,"
said Ben Ezra, "but I have this much more for thee. It
behooved me to bring both Miriam and Isaac to this
house, that I might cover them until this peril pass.
Roman eyes that thou knowest not may have looked upon
her. We must wait. The slaying of one slave dealer may
but make needful the hiring of another by some great
one. The house in which Isaac dwelt was but hired, and
another taketh it, that he and his may be thrust out. The
net is a wide one."</p>

<p>"Evil! Evil! Evil!" exclaimed Ulric. "This city is
full of injustice! No such thing could be among the
North peoples. I saw no thief ever, nor a purchased jarl
or judge, until I came southward."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p>"So doth the whole land groan," said Ben Ezra. "So
doth the blood of the innocent cry out unto Jehovah."</p>

<p>"Why, then, answereth he not?" shouted Ulric, vehemently.
"Surely the god of a people should come to their
help in such a distress, else they will surely say of him
that he is no god at all."</p>

<p>"So have said many," groaned Ben Ezra, "and I grow
weary in heart waiting for a Messiah who doth not come.
O that our King were already here. Peace, now, O jarl,
concerning him. But I will tell thee of Miriam that thou
mayest not have speech with her this night. Be thou not
also her enemy, to do her harm."</p>

<p>"Where is indeed thy god," said Ulric, "if any hurt
may come to such as she is?"</p>

<p>"O jarl," said Ben Ezra, "all Jerusalem hath heretofore
been heaped with the slain, and the maidens of Zion were
led away captive, because of the anger of Jehovah. Dost
thou not understand? We do suffer for our sins and for
the sins of our fathers."</p>

<p>"I think the gods do not well in such matters," said
Ulric. "They are not just. Surely justice becometh
well a brave god. He should not strike down the innocent
ones with those who are guilty of evil."</p>

<p>"I know not the counsel of the Most High," said Ben
Ezra. "His judgments are a great deep, but they are
just and righteous altogether."</p>

<p>"No man," said the jarl, "findeth fault with a stroke
of a sword fairly given, since he who dieth in battle goeth
to Valhalla and hath attained his inheritance from his
brave ancestors. I myself wait for the valkyrias, and I
am often weary thinking of the gods and of Asgard.
Who would avoid a sword if it were in the hand of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
brave warrior in battle? Not I, Ulric, the son of
Brander."</p>

<p>"Thou art a mighty man of valor," said Ben Ezra.
"I have thought of thee that thou art almost as a son of
Abraham. Go thou to thy sleeping, for this house must
be even more thy abiding place than is the house of Caius
now thy companions are departed."</p>

<p>Sleep came as to one who is weary both in mind and
body, but early upon the morrow the two friends were
together again taking counsel.</p>

<p>"O Jew," said the jarl, "I am ill at ease concerning my
men. Would that I might see them this day and make
sure of their welfare."</p>

<p>"So often doth one think of those who are departed
from him," said Ben Ezra; "but have thou a care that
thou inquire not imprudently. All that I may learn I will
tell thee when thou comest again. It is well for thee to
go now."</p>

<p>Out walked the jarl, going along a corridor which led
toward the door into the street.</p>

<p>"Very wonderful is all this," he thought. "A strange
place is this city of Jerusalem, with its many
rulers and its secrets of the gods and of the old time,
and with these things which are done here. Of what
good is it that it hath so great a temple and so many
priests?"</p>

<p>At that moment there came to his ears a beautiful, low
music murmuring through the cool air of the corridor.</p>

<p>"Ulric, art thou here?"</p>

<p>"Miriam!" he exclaimed, turning to listen.</p>

<p>"O, I thank thee that thou hast come," she said. "I
have had such fear upon me! Much rather would I die.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
One moment I must see thee and speak to thee! Tarry
a moment!"</p>

<p>"More I may not do, O Miriam," he said, with a great
light rising in his eyes. "But I have given my promise
to Ben Ezra and to thy God concerning thee that no harm
shall come upon thee. I will but look upon thy face."</p>

<p>"Thou art wonderful!" she said, and then they saw not
aught of all the world except each other for that breathing
space.</p>

<p>"O thou," she whispered, "I know not if thou art of
the heathen or if I am of Abraham's seed. O what but
death should part me and thee!"</p>

<p>"I think not even death," he said, "seeing that we go
to one place after the sword cometh. But if indeed thy
Jehovah be a god and if he have given me to thee, I will
offer to him many sacrifices. I must go forth now, for
I have many things to do for thee and for a friend. If
this Jesus of Nazareth arriveth, I must have speech with
him. I have told thee how he healed me."</p>

<p>"So must I see him," she said. "I listened to him
many times in Galilee. He is a very learned rabbi and I
would hear him again."</p>

<p>"He is more than a rabbi," said Ulric. "He is a god&mdash;and
he knoweth the other gods. I would ask him concerning
Asgard and Valhalla and concerning thee. Thy
slave dealer is dead, O Miriam, and soon will I deal justly
with this Abbas and those who are with him."</p>

<p>"Thou art my warrior!" she exclaimed. "Thou art as
one of the heroes of Israel. I trust thee!"</p>

<p>"Farewell!" he said stepping quickly away from her,
but no word escaped her lips. She did but seem to hold
back her hand from its purpose of detaining him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
her breath came and went rapidly as he passed out at the
door. Then her voice came again and she said, looking
upward:</p>

<p>"O thou Jehovah of Hosts, my God, hast thou not
made him also? How am I better than he that I should
be withheld from him? Do I not love him?"</p>

<p>The feet of Ulric went but slowly from the house of
Ben Ezra, and he paid little heed to their guiding, but
they brought him to the house of Caius of Thessalonica
and the warder of the portal stood before him.</p>

<p>"I have a word for thee, O swordsman," he said.
"Thou art well arrived."</p>

<p>"Say on," said Ulric.</p>

<p>"Even now, O Saxon, the procurator himself is with
our master Caius and with them is the governor of Joppa.
Thou mayest not go in. But pass thou to the Damascus
gate, for Caius would know of the arrival of this Galilean
healer. It is reported that he is near at hand. Also the
procurator would have speech with thee when Caius will
send thee to him. These are thy commands and thou wilt
do them."</p>

<p>"Say thou, O warder," replied Ulric, "that I go as I
am bidden. Well for thee and for us all if the centurion
were cured of this evil. Thou wilt fall into no better
hands than his if he dieth. I am his friend, and he suffereth."</p>

<p>"Go! Go!" said the warder, earnestly. "All the gods
forbid that he should die. If this same Jew rabbi will not
heal Caius, it is thy duty to slay him with thy sword."</p>

<p>"Speak thou only good concerning him," said Ulric,
sternly. "What hast thou to do with a sword? I go."</p>

<p>The warder stepped backward a pace, for not many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
men willed to stand before the jarl when his hand seemed
to be seeking for the hilt of his seax.</p>

<p>"A sudden man!" he muttered, as he watched his
going. "And they say he hath cleft both a lion and a
tiger in one combat and that he would wear no armor. A
man's head might go from his shoulders as if it were but
a flower from a stem. His eye is a fire!"</p>

<p>"I would I better knew the streets," said the jarl, as he
strode swiftly onward. "I learn them but slowly, for
they are very many and they are crooked and the city is
great. Whither, now, shall this one lead me?"</p>

<p>As in an unknown path, therefore, he went on, thinking
of many things. The way led him over a hill and through
a valley and to a gate in the outer wall that he knew well.
Here were Roman guards standing at rest, hindering
none, and Ulric halted near them. "Many go out," he
thought, "but a multitude cometh yonder along the road
across the Mount of Olives. I will wait and see."</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer along the broad highway poured a
vast throng of people, while through the gate passed on a
tide which went to mingle with them. Many of those
who were coming bore in their hands branches of palm
trees and they were shouting joyously.</p>

<p>"What is this which they sing?" said Ulric. "What
is the meaning of 'Hosanna in the highest,' and who is
David, and what is his son? It is a saga of the Jews.
The whole city is stirred up behind me. This is a
wonder!"</p>

<p>Across the valley and then up toward the gate came on
the multitude. Among them were some who took off
their outer robes and cast them upon the road before an
ass and before his rider, shouting and singing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have heard them say 'a king,'" said Ulric. "But
here is no king. None of these men are armed. What
saith the procurator to this business?"</p>

<p>"O gladiator of Caius of Thessalonica," suddenly responded
a legionary of the guard of the gate, "thou art
but a sword. What careth Pontius the Spearman for a
mob of women and children? We know thee that thou
art accounted trustworthy, and thou doest well to inquire
concerning any tumult of the Jews, but this is no affair
of either thine or ours."</p>

<p>"I meddle not," said the jarl. "I am under orders from
the centurion and from the procurator, but I may watch
this matter."</p>

<p>"Watch," said the officer. "Thou art in thy duty. We
hinder thee not. But who art thou?"</p>

<p>The man whom he now addressed was plainly a Jew,
in sordid raiment, tall and strong, but who was eyeing
the jarl with an evil eye, and his manner was insolent.</p>

<p>"I am a servant of the high priest and I am here by his
command," said the Jew. "There is an order for the
arrest of this gladiator."</p>

<p>"Let no accursed Jew take upon him that business,"
laughed the officer. "Thy high priest hath enough to
settle with the procurator. But whither goest thou from
hence?"</p>

<p>"I go to the gate of the valley of Hinnom," replied the
Jew, "and thou mayest not detain me."</p>

<p>"O officer," said Ulric, who had been searching the Jew
with keen inspection, "I have an errand to that gate and
know not the way overwell. I pray thee that thou command
him to guide me after I have seen this present
matter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>"I object not to that," said the Jew, with a fierce glitter
in his eyes, "so that he touch me not to render me unclean
against the Passover feast."</p>

<p>"Curse thy uncleanness!" said the Roman, haughtily.
"Thou needest not to touch him; but I would he might
have a commandment to touch thee. O gladiator, I am
told that thou art a sure blade, the slayer of the great
Numidian lion. I hope to see thee slay another yet in the
circus, but take not the head from this worthless one until
thou art duly bidden to smite him."</p>

<p>"As thou doest so do I," said Ulric. "Shall a soldier
question his captain?"</p>

<p>"Not if that commander be one Pontius the Spearman,"
replied the officer, "or even Caius of Thessalonica.
Thou art right, O gladiator. None will interfere with
thee and thy sharp edge."</p>

<p>"Stand by, thou," said Ulric to the Jew. "I will be
with thee presently."</p>

<p>But now the man became seemingly cringing and
friendly in his deportment, bowing low and standing in
silence awaiting direction.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the multitude along the highway
and toward the gate. Ulric heard many of them
shouting:</p>

<p>"This is Jesus of Nazareth, the Prophet of Galilee!
He is the son of David! He is the King of Israel. He
is the one who was to come! This is the Messiah, the
deliverer!"</p>

<p>Others there were who loudly gainsaid these acclamations,
protesting indignantly; but Ulric's thoughts were
full of astonishment.</p>

<p>"I see that the man upon the ass is Jesus. I know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
he is of the sons of the gods. This is a wonderful affair.
But why cometh he now without an army into a fortified
city which hath a Roman garrison? Odin! There is no
prudence in this coming! They will slay him before he
hath opportunity to gather men for one good legion."</p>

<p>So pondering in his mind, he watched until the ass and
his rider passed by him through the gate and into the
city.</p>

<p>"I have again seen his face," he said. "I may not have
speech with him at this time. But I will take upon me
this other errand and see unto what it will lead me. O
thou, my guide, we will depart."</p>

<p>"Come, O gladiator," said the Jew. "It is well for
thee to have me with thee among so many crooked streets.
Touch me not. But what are thy commandments?"</p>

<p>"Hold thou thy peace concerning them," replied the
jarl. "Lead on!"</p>

<p>Hot wrath burned for a moment in the face of the tall
Jew, but he obeyed, girding himself and striding forward,
but the officer of the gate laughed derisively.</p>

<p>"The dog Jew," he said, "will do well not to stir the
temper of a Saxon. His head were loosened from his
shoulders too quickly. I will not fail to see that fellow
in the circus. It mattereth not to me what work there
may be for his blade in Hinnom."</p>

<p>"Dost thou not bear in mind," said one of the legionaries,
"a certain slave dealer and the loosening of his
head? This same gladiator was seen that day at the
Hinnom gate, but the guards were bidden to forget him."</p>

<p>"Thou thyself rememberest too much," said the officer,
sternly. "Forget that thou hast seen him here this day.
But it is good sport to slay Jews. I would there might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
soon be another tumult. I have made the floor of the
temple red with the blood of Galileans. The procurator
may have a sharp teaching for more of them during this
Passover gathering."</p>

<p>So talked the soldiers of Rome, but the jarl was silent
and moody as he walked until he and his guide were
drawing near to the southerly wall of the city. Then he
spoke quietly, as a man may speak to his friend, one
whom he hath known well aforetime.</p>

<p>"O thou," he said, "when hast thou seen thy father,
Abbas, and what did he give unto thee concerning me?"</p>

<p>The guide turned suddenly, scowling and trembling,
but he responded:</p>

<p>"How knowest thou me? The guards knew me not,
nor did any other, for I am changed for that reason.
What hast thou to do with Abbas, and what is thy purpose?"</p>

<p>"Thou art but a fool," said Ulric. "I read thy name in
thy face. Thou art Bar Abbas. I have known thy father
many days. Did he not tell thee how I rescued him in the
tower in Esdraelon that he died not? But I have thought
him a prudent man. How is it that he hath permitted
this folly?"</p>

<p>"O gladiator," said Bar Abbas with a deep, dark smile,
"it is no folly. They who would slay me seek me in the
wilderness, not in Jerusalem. A man who waiteth within
the gate among the legionaries is hidden from the hunters
among the hills. I have seen my father and now I go to
meet him and his friend the master of the games in the
valley of Hinnom, as I believe thou, also, art informed
beforehand."</p>

<p>"Then thou hast delivered to him thy spoils?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
Ulric. "But canst thou give me a reason why I should
go to meet him in Hinnom?"</p>

<p>"That I know not," said Bar Abbas. "But the master
of the games is thy master also. He will give thee thy
direction."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, thou and he are unwise," said the jarl.
"I would thou wert armed."</p>

<p>"Save my dagger, I am not," replied the robber, "and
thou hast no weapon."</p>

<p>"A warrior is always armed," said Ulric. "But
now we are at the gate and here is the officer. Be thou
silent."</p>

<p>"Whither goest thou, O gladiator?" demanded the
sentinel. "This is forbidden thee. Thou art too far from
the circus."</p>

<p>"Dost thou indeed not know me?" responded the jarl.
"Or knowest thou not this signet of Caius of Thessalonica?"</p>

<p>"I do know thee, who thou art," said the officer, "and
I know the signet."</p>

<p>"By commandment of Pontius the Spearman, the procurator,"
said Ulric.</p>

<p>"I hear," said the Roman.</p>

<p>"Bind thou this Bar Abbas, the robber, and take him to
the prison and report to the procurator that I have done
as he did give me instruction. This thing is upon thy
life!"</p>

<p>Forward sprang Bar Abbas dagger in hand, but the
strong blow of a soldier smote him to the earth and he
was bound with cords.</p>

<p>"O man," shouted the captain of the gate, coming
hastily, "do as he biddeth thee. We also have full com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>mands
concerning Bar Abbas. Well do I know that this
is of the procurator."</p>

<p>Then turned he to the jarl.</p>

<p>"Thou hast more to do, O gladiator?"</p>

<p>"I may not answer thee," said Ulric, respectfully. "But
now do I go out into the valley to meet one who cometh,
and my duty is in my hand. I will return unto thee
shortly."</p>

<p>"Thou hast no weapon," said the Roman; but upon his
face was a look of understanding, for he was a man of
experience and he had been scanning carefully the raiment
of Ulric. "What if an evil person were to meet thee?"</p>

<p>"O captain," said Ulric, "he who obeyeth a command
doeth well. But if I return not with due speed know thou
that I am slain, and inquire into that business."</p>

<p>"That will I do," said the officer; "but they who slay
thee may indeed need an inquiry. I think it will not be
entirely well with them."</p>

<p>The jarl answered not a word, but he had now upon
his mind the things that had been told to him by Bar
Abbas on their way, and he went down into the valley,
walking rapidly.</p>

<p>"Before me is a trap," he said, "although it was not
set for me, but for some other. I will now fall into it, and
glad am I that I am so well prepared. This heavy, sharp-edged
gladius is better than my light seax."</p>

<p>Even then the captain of the gate was replying to a
question from the quaternion.</p>

<p>"The gladiator unarmed?" he exclaimed. "Do I not
know how a sheath will cause a wrinkle of a robe to
enlarge and stiffen? They who sent him are responsible,
not thou or I."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>The jarl went on a mile, it might be, and around him
was the smoke of the everlasting burning of Hinnom and
the smell from the untellable pollution. Here and there,
also, he saw heaps of half-consumed offal in which many
worms were crawling. This place was to all Jews the
picture and symbol of the punishment of the wicked after
death. Not many wayfarers were at any time to be encountered
here, for all men knew that it was a favorite
haunt of evil spirits, of demons, and of robbers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the jarl looked forward through the
unpleasant clouding of smoke he exclaimed, aloud:</p>

<p>"They come! Yonder is Abbas himself, and with him
are four men. They ride horses. I will wait until they
dismount, but woe to me if so much as one of them shall
escape."</p>

<p>He stood still, making sure of the hilt of his weapon,
but the horsemen came near and at once sprang to the
ground, coming forward.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou me?" said the foremost man. "Thy
fellows have escaped me, but thou shalt not. I will feed
thee to the wild beasts!"</p>

<p>"O master of the games," replied the jarl, "I am of the
household of Caius."</p>

<p>"And I am from Pontius the Spearman!" shouted the
master of the games. "O ye of Ethiopia, bind him fast!"</p>

<p>The three with him were black slaves, armed with
shields and short swords and jereeds, but they were
naked to their waists.</p>

<p>"Yield thee, O Saxon," cried out Abbas, mockingly.
"I have thy Miriam securely and she will soon belong to
my friend."</p>

<p>Now the master of the games was in full armor, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
had turned a moment for the ordering of his slaves. He
stooped a little, also, to loosen a coil of cordage that was
in his hand for the binding of the jarl, supposing him to
be unarmed and helpless against five armed men.</p>

<p>Then swiftly flashed the bright gladius in the hand of
Ulric and the head of the master of the games fell to the
earth.</p>

<p>"Thou hast sold Miriam?" heard Abbas, a hoarse
whisper, but he heard no more, for the sword had flashed
again.</p>

<p>The light shaft of a jereed snapped as its blade struck
upon the hidden mail of the jarl and the black striker fell
across the body of Abbas. His next companion was as
a defenseless man before the angry might of Ulric, and
hardly was he down before the slave to whom had been
given the holding of the horses lay among their hoofs.</p>

<p>"Sure am I that Abbas is dead," said Ulric, stooping
over him. "Not one of the others liveth. The horses
must now go back at speed. I would not have them seen
from the gate."</p>

<p>He pricked them sharply so that they ran in fear.
Then he wiped the gladius clean, concealed it well, and
walked back to the Hinnom gate of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"Hast thou accomplished thy command?" asked the
officer. "The time hath been but brief."</p>

<p>"Else were I not here," said Ulric. "There were those
who came by appointment and one of them was the father
of Bar Abbas. The others were but robbers like him."</p>

<p>"O gladiator," said the officer, "so will I report well of
thee. I think thou art a sure messenger for an errand of
blood."</p>

<p>Questions might not be pressed in such a case, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
soldiers were at once sent down the valley to make due
inquest.</p>

<p>Onward went Ulric through the streets of the city.</p>

<p>"O Miriam!" he groaned. "Would that I might live
for thee! But for this day's deed I think that I may soon
die. I will now go to the house of Ben Ezra and I will
tell him what hath thus been accomplished for him and
for her."</p>

<p>Even as he went his haste was hindered in a narrow
street by a great procession which seemed to be one of
rejoicing. Maidens came first, with clashing of cymbals
and with singing. Behind them were other musicians not
a few and many men and women. Then walked lightly
on a veiled one in bright robes that were adorned with
jewels. Attending her and following joyfully was the
remainder of the procession.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou inform me what this may be?" asked Ulric
of one who stepped apart from the others for a moment.</p>

<p>"O gladiator," replied the Jew, "this is the wedding of
my kinsman, Ananias, the son of the money changer of
the temple. He marrieth the Greek proselyte, Sapphira
the beautiful, the freed woman and favorite of the wife of
the procurator. She hath become a daughter of Abraham.
She now goeth to the house of the bridegroom to meet her
husband. There also is to be the wedding feast."</p>

<p>"I thank thee," said Ulric, but he walked on muttering
doubtfully: "Sapphira? Of the household of Pontius
the Spearman? I remember well. That was the name
of the beloved of Lysias."</p>

<span class="smcap"><small>The Passover Feast.</small></span></h2>


<p>"O jarl," exclaimed Ben Ezra as they stood together
in the house, "would that thou also wert a son of Abraham!
But thou hast done a deed for which thou wilt be
held to answer. O mighty man of valor, I fear that thy
life is forfeited to the law."</p>

<p>"Thinkest thou, O my friend," replied Ulric, "that
there is now any more peril to Miriam?"</p>

<p>"Not any," said Ben Ezra, "save that all dwellers upon
the earth are ever in peril from the evil. Every payment
hath been made. Her enemies are slain with the sword.
She may dwell in peace for a season. But if harm cometh
to thee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then," interrupted the jarl, "thou knowest that whatever
of mine thou hast in thy keeping belongeth to
Miriam. See thou to that!"</p>

<p>"Before Jehovah!" said Ben Ezra, "that will I do.
The jewels and the gold are hers. But what doest thou
now, seeing that the officer of the Hinnom gate will report
thee?"</p>

<p>"I sleep this night," said Ulric. "After that I purpose
going to the temple to hear the words of this son of the
gods from Nazareth. I will speak to him concerning
Caius. As for this affair of the valley of Hinnom, it is no
secret, and I may not hide myself."</p>

<p>"I also will hear the rabbi from Galilee," said Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
Ezra. "Yesterday he did boldly cleanse the temple of
such as were there contrary to the law."</p>

<p>The jarl listened in silence while the Jew told him
many things rapidly, but then he said:</p>

<p>"He is brave. I would I had been with him. I will ask
him if he needeth now a good sword. I will do as he shall
command me."</p>

<p>But now a servant of Isaac came to summon Ben Ezra,
and Ulric was alone.</p>

<p>"Would that I might see Miriam!" he murmured,
slowly, and a delight spoke laughingly in the soft tone
of his voice.</p>

<p>"Ulric, thy Miriam is here! Art thou in any peril?
Wilt thou not save thyself?"</p>

<p>She stood at his side touching him, and his strong
arms opened and he uttered a great cry, for she glided
into them and they were closed around her.</p>

<p>Who shall hear or tell the words that are uttered at
such a time, seeing that they are a thousandfold more
than words? He who would strive to repeat them is a
foolish one, as if he would echo the far-away music of a
song in the night.</p>

<p>"Thou art safe!" he said at last. "That is enough for
me. Trouble not thy heart overmuch. Only the gods
may see that which cometh to us on the morrow. Go thou
to thy chamber and thank thy God for me, telling him
that I will offer him a great offering and that henceforth
he shall be my God also for this thing which he hath done
for thee and me."</p>

<p>So she departed as one who must, but who willeth not
to go, and the night hours came upon all the city of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p>Now at an earlier hour of that day there had been
standing in the private room of Pontius the Spearman a
tall and stately matron attired in costly garments, and
before her stood a youth whose face was full of great
agony.</p>

<p>"Be thou silent!" she commanded. "This was my
doing. Questionest thou me? What is my freed woman
unto such as thou art? Thou hast naught to do with
Sapphira! Speak not of the matter to the procurator!
I do counsel thee well. Thou art but a youth, O Lysias,
and in youth there is folly!"</p>

<p>Low bent his head and his bosom heaved with pain, but
he was silent. The face of the matron was noble in shape,
and not unkindly, but in it was great haughtiness, for the
wife of the procurator was as a queen and no man might
question her will. She looked now at the young Greek,
pitying him for a moment, and then she went from the
room, saying no more, for the matter was ended, and he
yet stood there alone.</p>

<p>"All the gods have forgotten me," murmured Lysias.
"I will but make my report to the procurator and I will
depart&mdash;I care not whither."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the ruler of Judea entered the room,
striding as if in haste.</p>

<p>"Thou art here?" he said, and his face was red, as if
in hot anger. "Speak on, O Greek! Tell me of all thy
doings, from the first to the last, beginning with Cornelius
at Cæsarea."</p>

<p>"O most noble Pontius," said Lysias, "from the centurion,
this parchment, sealed. He gave me no words
to utter."</p>

<p>"I will read," said Pontius, but the epistle may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
been not only brief but troublesome, for his face darkened
yet more angrily.</p>

<p>"Speak on!" he commanded, and his messenger told all,
to the place where he had parted from Tostig and the
Saxons upon the shore of the harbor of Joppa.</p>

<p>"More than this is already known to me," said Pontius.
"Hast thou spoken at all of this matter?"</p>

<p>"Not to any ear but thine, my lord," said Lysias. "I
have been utterly prudent. Even the master of the games
cannot know concerning thy dealing with the secret messenger
of Herod."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest?" almost gasped the procurator.
"Very great is thy knowledge. Thou hast done well in
this affair. I will give thee now another errand. Call
unto me the sentinel in the outer corridor."</p>

<p>Quickly Lysias went and returned, bringing with him
one of the trusted legionaries of the palace guard who
had been on duty.</p>

<p>"Take thou this youth," said Pontius, "and lead him
to the fifth chamber of the lower corridor. Summon thou
to that room one whom thou knowest. Say to him that
I will see him again without delay. Then return thou
to thy post."</p>

<p>"Follow!" said the soldier to Lysias. "I am bidden to
show thee a certain matter."</p>

<p>Lysias obeyed, but with a faintness coming coldly upon
him, but as he went there was a sad thought weighing
upon his heart.</p>

<p>"O that I might but see her! Did she indeed wed him
of her own free will? My beloved! O my Sapphira! O
my beautiful one! I found thee but to lose thee!"</p>

<p>There was a stairway, and at the bottom of that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
was a long passage. It was gloomy and dingy as of a
prison, with closed cages on either side. Here, also, one
shortly came and walked with them, a short, broad man
in armor, who spoke not.</p>

<p>Lysias himself counted the doors.</p>

<p>"The fifth," he said. "It is open."</p>

<p>"Enter!" commanded the soldier, but he followed not,
and the short, dark man went in behind Lysias.</p>

<p>The door closed clanging, and then there was a silence
save for the feet of the departing legionary and a sharp
sound of a cry from that fifth chamber. A minute passed
and then another, and the short, dark man came out alone.</p>

<p>"The Greek," he said, "hath accomplished the errand
upon which the procurator sent him. But there is blood
upon my hand, and I will wash well before I report to
the Spearman lest he inquire of me."</p>

<p>At that hour there was joyous feasting at the house
of the father of the Jew Ananias. The bridegroom welcomed
his kindred and his friends and the red wine was
plentiful. In the apartment of the women sat the bride
arrayed in her jeweled robes. All the women who looked
upon her praised her, wondering at her great beauty.
They said that Ananias had won the pearl, the pearl of
pearls, the ruby of rubies, the rose of Sharon and the lily
of the valley. Very joyful, also, was Sapphira, for her
triumph and her happiness had come to her; but there
came a moment when she suddenly put her hand upon
her bosom.</p>

<p>"Lysias!" she whispered. "Did I hear him speak to
me? Again! It is gone! Thank Aphrodite and thank
Juno. It is better to be a wedded woman, a proselyte of
the temple, than to be a bondwoman of the procurator."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>The days of the wedding feast were to be cut short by
the coming of the Passover, for only by express permission
of the rabbis had the command of the wife of Pontius
been obeyed at such a time. It was well, they admitted,
to change a law to obtain a proselyte from the household
of the procurator. The next day, however, would not be
altogether sacred, and the wedding feast might go on,
but it might be extended no further lest there should be
a grievous sin against the counting of days. When the
next day came, therefore, all things belonging to it followed
in their order.</p>

<p>There was a great gathering in the court of the women
in the temple, for here had come the prophet from Galilee,
and he was not only preaching, but healing also. In front
of him where he stood there was seated upon the pavement
a closely veiled one, whose head was bowed. It was
as if she might also be praying silently.</p>

<p>The sick and the maimed and the blind and many who
were in tribulation came and stood by her for a moment
to be touched by the rabbi and to make room for others
to be healed in like manner. These fell away full of joy
over that which had come to them, but the veiled one
moved not, nor did several of the other women who were
near. Once only did she lift her head, drawing aside her
veil, and her voice was low and sweet.</p>

<p>"O Master, what shall I ask of thee concerning Ulric?
Canst thou do aught for him?"</p>

<p>"Be thou contented," he said. "He followeth me."
He stooped and put his hand upon her head and turned
away, for he was departing from that place to the court
of the heathen. So she covered her face with her veil and
left the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>In the court of the heathen was a gathering that was
dense for multitude, and here, also, were many who asked
for healing. Near to a pillar by the outer portico stood
twain who had just arrived.</p>

<p>"O Caius," said one, "hast thou strength to stand upon
thy feet for a little?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, O jarl," said the centurion. "But I am a
Roman. What part have I in this Jew rabbi and his
god?"</p>

<p>"Nay, but stand thou here," said Ulric, "while I go and
ask him."</p>

<p>On pressed he through the crowd until he stood before
the prophet of Galilee.</p>

<p>"O thou of the sons of the gods," he said, "wilt thou
heal a Roman, standing yonder, as thou hast healed me,
who am a Saxon? I pray thee have mercy upon him, for
he is my friend."</p>

<p>Now he had thus interrupted men of dignities and
learning who were standing there asking questions of
Jesus and gainsaying him, and these rebuked the jarl
angrily.</p>

<p>The reply of Jesus was to them in words, but Ulric fell
back thinking within himself: "His face hath answered
me. I know not what this is. I will have speech with
him at another time. O that I may be with him in the
day of the great battle!"</p>

<p>Slowly through the throng he went back to Caius at
the pillar against which he had been faintly leaning.</p>

<p>"O Caius," he said, "I did ask him. Thou wilt yet
speak to him for thyself."</p>

<p>"Jarl of the Saxons," exclaimed Caius, "I go now to
my chariot. Speak not. Seest thou not that I am standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
firmly? The pain of the hurt hath departed! But here
came one with a commandment from the procurator bidding
thee to his house with speed. Delay not thy going,
and deal with him as thou wouldst deal with me. I thank
thee and I thank the rabbi. Go!"</p>

<p>"O gladiator, come thou in haste!" said one in the
raiment of a bondservant who stood near. "The thing
is important!"</p>

<p>"Tell him I come," said Ulric. "Wait not. I go not in
thy company. But glad am I, O Caius, my friend, if thou
art healed of the poison."</p>

<p>"That I know not," said Caius; "but the burning ceaseth.
Return thou soon to me."</p>

<p>"O most noble Caius," said Ulric, "I think this matter
of the procurator is already known to me. If I see thee
not again, may all be well with thee!"</p>

<p>His countenance was bright and his step was firm and
he turned away from Caius, going toward the outer entrance
of the court of the women. The distance was but
short, and here under the portico waited the veiled one.</p>

<p>"Art thou here?" she said. "Hast thou indeed seen
him? I spoke to him concerning thee and he told me
thou wouldst surely follow him."</p>

<p>"I know not that," he said, "but lift thy veil, O Miriam,
that I may see thee&mdash;this last seeing. I go hence to death,
but O that to thee might come life and joy forever!"</p>

<p>Her unveiled face before him was white with terror and
with agony.</p>

<p>"O my beloved, what sayest thou?" she exclaimed.
"To thy death?"</p>

<p>"I will wait for thee in Valhalla," said the jarl. "I
will have a fair house for thee in the city of Asgard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
There thou shalt live with me among the gods. I think
this Jesus of Nazareth will also be there, for he is a Son
of God and he is my friend and thy friend. Go thou to
thy house. Fare thee well!"</p>

<p>Strong and brave grew her face and her form was erect
when she responded: "O my beloved, if thou art indeed
going now to thy death, then will I also wait and I will
come unto thee in thy high place, as thou hast said. From
the prophet of Galilee have I heard a new thing concerning
those who die, that they have a better country than
this and a better city to dwell in. I had not known&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Miriam," said Ulric, "it is not new to me. So say
all the old sagas of the Northland. This have I been
taught by Hilda from my childhood. She also will be
there, and all my kindred, with thee and me."</p>

<p>None saw, but a swift kiss fell upon her lips and then
her veil was drawn, but Ulric went from the portico joyously,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I care not now! She may bring me my ruby in the
city of the gods, and I, the son of Odin, will keep tryst
with her whom I love. O Pontius! O Spearman! O
procurator! I will show thee how little a Saxon jarl careth
for the edge of a sword."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, from that hour onward none saw the
jarl, and two days went by. These were days of sorrow
and of doubt for Miriam, waiting lonely in the house of
Ben Ezra. She indeed went forth veiled to listen to the
preaching of the prophet of Galilee, but ever her eyes
were searching among the throngs of hearers for one who
came not. "O that he might have heard these things
also," she said within her heart. "Did not Ulric himself
say that this is the captain who is also his king? How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
shall he now follow him into any battle? O that it might
be!"</p>

<p>So thought Miriam, praying and weeping, and around
her were many other women. "O weeping one," said one
of these, "knowest thou not? The Master himself hath
said to us that he is to be crucified!"</p>

<p>"Crucified!" exclaimed Miriam.</p>

<p>"Yea," said the other, "but that in three days he will
arise from the dead and that then he will take the kingdom.
It is a hard saying."</p>

<p>"That the dead rise we do know," replied Miriam, "but
none hath ever seen them after their resurrection. I think
this saying is like the words of my beloved concerning the
city of the gods where I am to live with him. And he&mdash;O
God of Israel! Where is he now and what hath befallen
him?"</p>

<p>The evening of that day was set apart for the feast of
the Passover. Many were gathered to eat of it at the
house of Ben Ezra, for the kinsfolk of Isaac came also
to partake of it. The Scriptures were read and hymns
and psalms were sung, and they communed sorrowfully
concerning the present desolation of their people, the
terrors of the Herods, the oppression of the Romans, and
their fears of the things which were yet to come upon
them. After this some of them slumbered, but not all.
There were those who waked and watched, for through
all the city had gone a saying of Jesus of Nazareth that
he was the Messiah, and that his kingdom was at hand.</p>

<p>Even the Romans had heard of this saying, but Pontius
the Spearman had laughed, for he thought of his forts
and his legionaries and he troubled not his mind concerning
some unarmed mob of Jewish enthusiasts.</p>

"<span class="smcap"><small>A Little While.</small></span>"</h2>


<p>It was toward the morning of a new day that one
came knocking loudly at the door of the house of Ben
Ezra.</p>

<p>"What wilt thou?" asked the porter, partly opening
the door and looking forth.</p>

<p>"Tell thou to those who are within," was responded,
"that the Romans and the chief priests have taken the
prophet of Galilee by force. He is now at the palace of
the procurator and a great multitude gathereth. I am a
kinsman of Isaac, the aged."</p>

<p>Several were within hearing and the message passed
quickly throughout the house. There was then hurried
girding of robes and putting on of sandals.</p>

<p>"We will go forth," said Ben Ezra. "I would see what
this thing meaneth. He hath done nothing for which he
might be taken, either under the law of the Jews or the
law of the Romans."</p>

<p>Some said one thing and some another, and so it was
over the entire city, for great was the tumult which was
arising in Jerusalem. It was said that Jesus had been
arrested in the night upon the Mount of Olives, beyond
the brook Kidron, after he had eaten the Passover in the
city with his disciples. Neither he nor they had fought
save for a blow or two, and no man had been slain. Jesus
had been taken before the high priest and before Herod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
the tetrarch, and before the procurator, by whom he was
now to be judged, the others not having due authority.
The tetrarch was in the city at this season by reason of
the Passover, although it was known that he was at
enmity with Pontius the Spearman.</p>

<p>There were many rumors, nor was it easy to determine
what report to believe, but when Ben Ezra and Isaac and
their company came to the palace of the procurator they
saw a strange matter. Outside of the palace was a place
which was called the Pavement, and to this, and not into
the house, the strictest Jews might advance and not become
unclean, to be afterward unfitted for the Passover
worship in the temple. Out of this place had been brought
a throne chair of the procurator, and in it he now was
seated for judgment, surrounded by armed legionaries
and men of high degree, as if some matter of importance
called for his decision.</p>

<p>Before him, as one who is accused of some crime and
is awaiting decision, stood Jesus of Nazareth, but not as
any had ever before seen him. He had been both stripped
and scourged, and the soldiers of the procurator, besides
beating and mocking him, had derisively arrayed him in a
purple robe of royalty; but the crown which they had
put upon his head was a torture crown, plaited of thorn-tree
twigs.</p>

<p>The procurator himself now spoke, not to the prisoner
before him, but to the surging mob of Jews upon the
Pavement and in the street.</p>

<p>"Behold the man!" he said.</p>

<p>Then arose an angry roar of many voices, among
which the loudest words were:</p>

<p>"Crucify! Crucify! Crucify!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take him yourselves and crucify him," said the procurator,
"for I find no crime in him."</p>

<p>Then said one to Ben Ezra: "Already he hath been
tried and condemned before Herod, the king. Also he
hath been well examined and scourged duly by the procurator.
Let him die!"</p>

<p>There were many who responded in divers forms of
speech to the utterance of the procurator, but a ruler
among the Jews shouted loudly:</p>

<p>"We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because
he made himself the Son of God."</p>

<p>When Pontius heard that he arose and went into the
palace for a little space, taking the prisoner with him.
What further examination was made thus in private the
multitude knew not, but when again the procurator came
forth, having Jesus brought also, he said to the Jews:</p>

<p>"Which of these twain shall I release unto you, Bar
Abbas, the robber, or Jesus who is called the Christ, the
King of the Jews?"</p>

<p>But they all answered him with shouts of "Bar Abbas!"
for among the rabble were many priests and scribes who
were stirring them up to do this thing. Other things
were said, both by the procurator and the accusers, but
it seemed that he would willingly have refrained from
doing any further violence to this man.</p>

<p>"Behold your king!" he said, at last.</p>

<p>"Away with him! Crucify! Crucify!" came back the
tumult of fierce voices.</p>

<p>"Shall I crucify your king?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We have no king but Cæsar," responded one, and
another added: "If thou spare him, thou art no friend of
Cæsar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a servant of the procurator brought out to him a
basin of water, and in this he washed his hands, saying
to them: "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous
person. See ye to it."</p>

<p>"His blood be upon us and upon our children!" roared
the mob.</p>

<p>Then Pontius reentered the palace and the soldiers led
away the prisoner, for his crucifixion had been commanded,
and there is never any great delay in the performance
of a Roman execution.</p>

<p>"Let us follow, O Isaac," said Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>In the shadow behind him stood Miriam. "I also will
follow with you," she said, "for Jesus of Nazareth is my
King."</p>

<p>Within the palace shortly after this, and in the small
chamber near the hall of judgment, stood twain who
seemed to be having earnest words with one another.</p>

<p>"O Caius, my friend," said the procurator, gloomily,
"am I not in a strait place this day? I have heard thee.
Gladly would I grant any request of thine, as thou knowest.
I may not hear thee as to this King of the Jews.
As to thy gladiator, I would give him back to thee if it
were possible, but his evil deeds are too many. Without
warrant or command he slew my slave dealer in the valley
of Hinnom. He slew the master of the games who was
over him, and with him also three slaves and the Jew
merchant Abbas. Moreover, I have word from the proconsul
of Spain that Saxon pirates under this Ulric the
Jarl destroyed two of Cæsar's triremes in the British seas.
More things than these are justly charged to his account.
What say est thou?"</p>

<p>"Thou art justified," said Caius, reluctantly. "I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
urge thee no more. But I would gladly have saved him.
This matter of Jesus of Nazareth would indeed be
brought against thee before Cæsar. It is well for thee
that thou art at peace with Herod, the fox."</p>

<p>"I did indeed strive to save the Galilean rabbi," said
Pontius. "I will tell thee a thing. My own wife had a
dream concerning him and she warned me not to condemn
him as of myself. To me, also, he declared himself to be
of the gods. I meddle not with them, for little do we
know of the gods. But I have this to ask of thee, that
thou wilt be my witness of this crucifixion, that I may
truly know of whatever shall there occur."</p>

<p>"That will I do!" exclaimed Caius. "I also would see
how he dieth, for I have heard many strange things. It
would be a rare thing to see a god upon a cross. Where,
now, will be his kingdom and who shall do him reverence?
I know not, surely, that it was indeed through him
that I am healed of my hurt. So say a great many others
who are cured. Their evils have departed from them,
they know not how. We do know that no man hath such
power as this."</p>

<p>"How did he deal with thee?" asked Pontius.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied the centurion. "I stood at a distance
when he looked upon me, and I felt the blood changing
in my veins. He did not touch me. How, then, was
the healing?"</p>

<p>"This is wonderful," said the procurator. "I will hear
thee again about that matter. Go, now, I pray thee.
With him and with thy Saxon there will also be crucified
a strong rebel from the Lebanon who was captured in
Judea. Upon his hands is the blood of many. For this
consent of thine I thank thee."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>
<p>During this time a long procession, accompanied and
followed by a mixed and growing multitude, was passing
slowly through the streets of Jerusalem. At its head,
although many marched on in advance, were a quaternion
of legionaries and their officer. Close by these were functionaries
of the high priest and rulers of the Jews, with
zealous scribes and Pharisees and officers from the household
of Herod, the tetrarch. Next in the procession
walked three who bore upon their shoulders heavy beams
of wood. All three were suffering from the lacerations
of the Roman scourge, and one was so far weakened that
he fell under his burden.</p>

<p>"Bring me hither that huge Jew!" said the Roman
officer in command.</p>

<p>"I bring him," quickly replied a soldier. "He saith
that he is one Simon of Cyrene."</p>

<p>"Let him carry the cross for Jesus of Nazareth," said
the officer. "We may not be delayed. Scourge him forward!"</p>

<p>So again the procession moved on toward the place of
execution.</p>

<p>Upon the bosom of each of the condemned ones, to be
afterward affixed over his head upon his wood of torment,
swung a wooden tablet inscribed with his name and
with his crime. Of these tablets the first was written in
Latin only, and it told of the rebel of the Lebanon. Upon
the second was written:</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Ulric, the Saxon Murderer.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>Upon the third, a larger tablet, was inscribed, in Latin
and in Greek and in Hebrew:</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">This is Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>Of this rather than of the others the rabble shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
mockeries as they read, for here, they said, was a king
upon his way to die as a common malefactor, and for him
there was no salvation.</p>

<p>Silent was Ulric the Jarl, even when his eyes met those
of Caius of Thessalonica, but the centurion drew near to
him and said:</p>

<p>"O jarl of the Saxons, I did what I could, but it was
beyond my power to rescue thee. Thy sword hath fallen
upon too many and thy condemnation is just."</p>

<p>No answer made Ulric, and the centurion turned away
his horse.</p>

<p>The gate had been passed and now the low hill of
Calvary, or Golgotha, was at hand. The multitude grew
as the rising tide of the sea, for all Jerusalem was stirred
by this affair and the prophet of Galilee had friends as
well as enemies, and many who came were weeping
bitterly.</p>

<p>"In a strange manner," thought the jarl, "have the
valkyrias come for me and for him. Where, now, is his
father, that he hath thus deserted his son in such a place?
Are the Romans more powerful than the gods? It is but
little that we must die. Shortly I shall be in Valhalla, and
I think Hilda will come to meet me at some place that is
appointed. There, also, I will wait for Miriam until she
shall come. I am glad that I have smitten down her
enemies, giving my life for hers, and that I have made
provision for her welfare."</p>

<p>The summit of the hill was level, and here a space was
kept clear that the multitude might not hinder by pressing.
Here were three holes in the earth already dug to
receive the long timbers after the crosspieces and the
victims should be spiked upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>The raiment of the condemned was the execution fee of
the Roman soldiers, and there was a stripping done, but
the tunic of Jesus was gambled for by them because it
was of one piece, to be spoiled by dividing.</p>

<p>The three crosses now lay upon the sand and Ulric
looked earnestly upon them, for a strong and sudden
memory came into his mind.</p>

<p>"The token of Hilda!" he exclaimed, but in a whisper,
hoarse with pain. "These are but as the runes that she
showed me upon the sandy beach of the North coast
before I sailed thence in <i>The Sword</i>. Now know I that
my voyage is ended, and I die, as she said, by the hands
of the soldiers of Cæsar. But I had not thought of such a
death as this!"</p>

<p>First of all did the soldiers seize rudely upon Jesus,
scoffing at him, and terrible was the swiftly performed
work of the driving of the spikes, but there was not
heard by any a cry of pain.</p>

<p>"Brave is he!" thought Ulric. "I also will hold my
peace."</p>

<p>Firm, also, was the courage of the rebel Jew from the
Lebanon, and the multitude wondered greatly at the fortitude
of these who suffered this horror silently.</p>

<p>One by one did the soldiers and their helpers lift the
crosses, fixing them firmly in the earth, and a loud shouting
of the rabble arose at the lifting, but there was also
weeping and wailing and beating of breasts among the
multitude.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cross of Jesus now knelt women and
men to whom he spoke, and he also uttered words to some
who were not so near.</p>

<p>In front of the cross whereon the jarl was nailed there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
came for a moment a veiled one, putting aside her veil
and gazing wistfully into his face.</p>

<p>"O my beloved, thou!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Miriam! Loved one!" he groaned, being in great
agony, "tarry not here! Look not upon me! Thine eyes
are more than I may bear! Go to thy house!"</p>

<p>Her lips parted and she strove to speak, but a great
tremor shook her, and no voice came from her lips except
a low, hard cry, having in it what seemed the name of her
god. Then turned she away and she had fallen but that
the arm of Ben Ezra went quickly around her, and he
compelled her to go away a little space that she might
kneel and wait.</p>

<p>Time passeth slowly to one who hangeth upon a cross,
desiring the coming of the end. The sun beat down
hotly. The multitude came and went, and all the open
space, to the highway and beyond, was a dense throng.</p>

<p>"I heard him," thought Ulric. "He hath spoken to his
father more than once. If I speak to the gods, are they
now near enough to hear me? I think not; but I shall see
them shortly."</p>

<p>The man upon the third cross turned now in his writhing
and he said to Jesus:</p>

<p>"Art not thou the Christ? Save thyself and us!"</p>

<p>Jesus answered not, but the jarl cried out:</p>

<p>"Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same
condemnation? And we, indeed, justly, for we receive
the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done
nothing amiss." Then he said to the Christ: "Jesus,
remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom!"</p>

<p>Unto him did Jesus make answer: "Verily I say unto
thee, This day shalt thou be with me in the Garden."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>Then followed a stillness, but the jarl thought of the
word which was given him. "I knew not of this garden.
There it is that I am to be with him and with the gods.
There, also, I shall see Hilda, and Miriam will dwell with
me in the garden. It is enough! I am content!"</p>

<p>Great was the cruelty of the Jews and of the rabble,
and the hatred of some for Jesus was exhibited in mocking
speeches. It was as if they took pleasure in the
tokens of his sufferings.</p>

<p>It was now afternoon, and for some time Jesus had
been silent, but suddenly and with a loud voice he cried
out:</p>

<p>"My God! my God! Why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>

<p>To that utterance the Jews replied in a manner which
Ulric did not understand, but again Jesus cried out,
saying:</p>

<p>"I thirst!"</p>

<p>A horrible thirst cometh upon those who are crucified,
and a drink of vinegar and myrrh with other bitterness is
always provided for them by some who are merciful.
One ran and took a sponge, soaking it with this provision,
and lifted it upon a reed to the lips which were burning.</p>

<p>At that moment Jesus uttered an exceedingly great
voice of pain, and instantly it was seen that his soul had
departed from his body. He was dead.</p>

<p>"Would that I were as he!" thought the jarl, "that
I might be free of this agony and pass on to Valhalla and
into this garden to which Jesus hath gone before me!"</p>

<p>The multitude were not gazing as before upon these
who were crucified, for now the light of the sun was withdrawn
and a great gloom was over all things. The earth
quaked under their feet. Great rocks were rended. Fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
fell upon men and women, and with one accord they fled
away toward the city, beating their breasts and mourning.</p>

<p>Caius of Thessalonica stood watching these things, and
other Romans with him. "Certainly," he exclaimed,
"this was a righteous man. Truly this was the Son of
God!"</p>

<p>But the Jews had taken thought beforehand for yet
another matter. The next day would be their Sabbath,
a holy day, and by their law it was not well for one to be
left upon a cross over the Sabbath. Therefore they had
obtained from the procurator an order that the deaths of
these three might be hastened by the breaking of their
bones. For this business came soldiers with clubs, but
they struck not any limb of Jesus, who was already dead.</p>

<p>"I have no mark of a spear," thought Ulric. "It
is not well. I die without any wound except of these
spikes."</p>

<p>Near to him then were these soldiers, but he saw one
of them thrust a pilum blade into the side of Jesus,
making a wound from which poured both blood and
water. Quickly, now, came merciful relief to the two
others, for the soldiers made an end.</p>

<p>Afterward were all the bodies taken down from the
crosses, as was required by the law of the religion of the
Jews, and the friends of any man were permitted to do
their will concerning him.</p>

<p>The sun had long since set, and the darkness was over
the earth, when a little company of men and women
entered the door of the house of Ben Ezra.</p>

<p>"O Miriam, my daughter," said Isaac, the aged, when
they were within, "thou mayest mourn, but be thou comforted.
We have buried him in my own tomb. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
didst thou not hear what was said to him by Jesus of
Nazareth? In him do I now believe. He is God!"</p>

<p>"O my beloved!" wailed Miriam, and she said no more
for weeping.</p>

<p>"Miriam," continued Ben Ezra, "I also believe; trust
thou, concerning thy husband, that it is well with him!"</p>

<p>"Ye are my friends," said Miriam. "I heard the saying,
faintly and far. They are at this hour in the garden,
do you say? But I am here and I am alone, for my love
hath been taken from me. Nevertheless, I will be patient.
It is but for a little while; a little while!"<br /><br /></p>

turns, while they keep us voraciously reading to the end.... There is, in fact, not a story
in the book which does not leave us hungering for more."&mdash;<i>Christian World.</i></p>

<p>"Drawn with a vividness and subtle charm that must appeal to all who love to study the
poetry of human nature. Mr. Dunk is a master in the art of expression. Each tale is a
poem in prose, and his knowledge of the heart and mind of the Cornish Methodist is
profound, while his originality and grace of expression are of a high order."&mdash;<i>Birmingham

<p>"Presented with a vividness and tender sympathy that appeal strongly to those who
have any knowledge of the reality of the religious life of the village Methodists of the past
generation. Homely, kindly, saturated with a belief in the vitality of religion, these simple
folk live and move in a lifelike way. Humour and pathos alternate with strong religious
feeling and simple narrative."&mdash;<i>Sheffield and Rotherham Independent.</i></p>
